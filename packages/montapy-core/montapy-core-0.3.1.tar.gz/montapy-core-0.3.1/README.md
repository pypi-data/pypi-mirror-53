# MontaPy Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/montapy/core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/montapy/core)

It's a core package for all montapy code. It contains shared modules, classes and other resources which may be used across all spysy packages.

> NOTE! The project is havy under development. A structure of the project may be changed in any minute. There ara no any clear roadmap yet. I surprised that you have found this package, sure :)
