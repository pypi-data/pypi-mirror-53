/* sapphire.cpp -- the Sapphire II stream cipher class.
   Dedicated to the Public Domain the author and inventor:

   Ported from the Pascal implementation of the Sapphire Stream
   Cipher 9 December 1994.
   Added hash pre- and post-processing 27 December 1994.
   Modified initialization to make index variables key dependent,
   made the output function more resistant to cryptanalysis,
   and renamed to Sapphire II 2 January 1995
