Syntax Maker
=============
The tool NLG tool for Finnish by `Mika Hämäläinen <https://mikakalevi.com>`_


Syntax maker is the natural language generation tool for generating syntactically correct sentences in Finnish automatically. The tool is especially useful in the case of Finnish which has such a high diversity in its morphosyntax. All you need to know are the lemmas and their parts-of-speech and syntax maker will take care of the rest.

For instance, just throw in words rantaleijona, uneksia, korkea and aalto and you will get rantaleijonat uneksivat korkeista aalloista. So you will get the morphology right automatically! Don't believe me? `Just take a look at this tutorial to find out how. <https://github.com/mikahama/syntaxmaker/wiki/Creating-a-sentence,-the-basics>`_

**Update:** Python 2 and Python 3 are both now supported!
