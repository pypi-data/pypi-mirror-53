# ganglion-biosensing

Modern Python 3.7+ library for interfacing with the OpenBCI Ganglion biosensing board over BTLE.

The origins of this library come from my personal disagreement with some of the design and implementation choices made by the developers of the official [pyOpenBCI library](https://github.com/OpenBCI/pyOpenBCI), as well as their slow responses to pull requests. Some of the code in this repository has been obtained and/or adapted from the official pyOpenBCI code (following the MIT License).

It should be noted that this library does not aim to be a full replacement for the official library, as it is completely focused on the Ganglion board and not on the Cyton. It should rather be looked at as an alternative which aims to target a more modern and efficient implementation from the ground up.
