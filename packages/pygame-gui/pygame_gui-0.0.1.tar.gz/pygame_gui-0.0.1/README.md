# Pygame GUI
A GUI system for pygame 2 (it may also work OK on earlier versions of pygame).

## How to install

1. Download this repository someplace onto your computer. 
2. Using a terminal or Command Prompt type of tool with administrator privileges, navigate to the root directory of the repository (the one containing setup.py). There is a terminal available in PyCharm if that is your editor of choice, you will have to edit the shortcut that opens PyCharm to 'Run as administrator' (available under Advanced options).
3. Once you are at the command prompt type:
```
pip install .
```
4. If all goes well you should see a message about game_gui being installed successfully and will be able to find pygame_gui in the list of installed packages for your python interpreter (PyCharm displays these as a nice list under File->Settings->Project:project_name->Project Interpreter). 
5. Should you need to delete pygame_gui for any reason then PyCharm will also let you do that from the same Project Interpreter settings window using the red minus symbol button.

## Making use of the library

There will be more extensive documentation coming soon, but for now try out the examples at the [pygame_gui_examples repository](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui_examples).
