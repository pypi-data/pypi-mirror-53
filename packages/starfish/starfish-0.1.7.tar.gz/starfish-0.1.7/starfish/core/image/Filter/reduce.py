class Reduce(FilterAlgorithm):
    """
    Reduces the cardinality of one or more axes to 1 by applying a function across those axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dims : Iterable[Union[Axes, str]]
        one or more Axes to reduce over
    func : str
        Name of a function in the module specified by the ``module`` parameter to apply across the
        dimension(s) specified by dims.  The function is resolved by ``getattr(<module>, func)``,
        except in the cases of predefined aliases.  See :py:class:`FunctionSource` for more
        information about aliases.

        Some common examples for the np FunctionSource:

        - amax: maximum intensity projection (applies np.amax)
        - max: maximum intensity projection (this is an alias for amax and applies np.amax)
        - mean: take the mean across the dim(s) (applies np.mean)
        - sum: sum across the dim(s) (applies np.sum)
    module : FunctionSource
        Python module that serves as the source of the function.  It must be listed as one of the
        members of :py:class:`FunctionSource`.

        Currently, the supported FunctionSources are:
        - ``np``: the top-level package of numpy
        - ``scipy``: the top-level package of scipy
    clip_method : Clip
        (Default Clip.CLIP) Controls the way that data are scaled to retain skimage dtype
        requirements that float data fall in [0, 1].
        Clip.CLIP: data above 1 are set to 1, and below 0 are set to 0
        Clip.SCALE_BY_IMAGE: data above 1 are scaled by the maximum value, with the maximum
        value calculated over the entire ImageStack

    Examples
    --------
    Reducing via max projection.
        >>> from starfish.core.imagestack.test.factories.synthetic_stack import synthetic_stack
        >>> from starfish.image import Filter
        >>> from starfish.types import Axes
        >>> stack = synthetic_stack()
        >>> reducer = Filter.Reduce({Axes.ROUND}, func="max")
        >>> max_proj = reducer.run(stack)

    Reducing via linalg.norm
        >>> from starfish.core.imagestack.test.factories.synthetic_stack import synthetic_stack
        >>> from starfish.image import Filter
        >>> from starfish.types import Axes

        Generally, the packages should be those that are included as starfish's dependencies for

        Many packages are broken into subpackages which are not necessarily implicitly imported when
        importing the top-level package.  For example, ``scipy.linalg`` is not implicitly imported
        when one imports ``scipy``.  To avoid the complexity of enumerating each scipy subpackage in
        FunctionSource, we assemble the fully-qualified method name, and then try all the
        permutations of how one could import that method.

        In the example of ``scipy.linalg.norm``, we try the following:
