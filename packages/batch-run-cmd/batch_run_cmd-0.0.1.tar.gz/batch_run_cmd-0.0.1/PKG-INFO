Description: # batch-run-cmd
        
        ## 1 Introduction
        
        
        See `https://github.com/linzhi2013/batch-run-cmd`.
        
        This is a Python3 package which will read command lines from an input file,
        and run each line of command one by one, and check their exit status.
        
        More importantly, if one command fails, you can just jump to next command
        (`-e` option)
        
        
        ## 2 Installation
        
        with `pip`
        
            $ pip install batch-run-cmd
        
        There will be a command `batch-run-cmd` created under the same directory as your `pip` command.
        
        ## 3 Usage
        run `batch_run_cmd`
        
            $ batch_run_cmd
            usage: batch_run_cmd [-h] [-f <file>] [-e <int> [<int> ...]]
        
                To run commands line by line, and check each exit status.
                See https://github.com/linzhi2013/batch-run-cmd for more details.
        
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -f <file>             commands in a file.
              -e <int> [<int> ...]  continueOnReturnCode [[0]]
