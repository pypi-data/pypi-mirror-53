Description: # pygoa_gemini
        A simple python library for working with the [Gemini Observatory Archive (GOA) APIs](https://archive.gemini.edu/help/api.html)
        
        ## Installation
        The scripts require a standard python distribution that includes 
        the requests package. This is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.
        
        Then install the library by downloading and unpacking the zip
        file or use git,
        
            git clone https://github.com/bryanmiller/pygoa_gemini.git
        
        or pip
        
            pip install pygoa-gemini
        
        ## Authentication
        
        In order to download prioprietary data you must provide the GOA authentication
        cookie from a web browser.  Updated instructions for how to find the cookie are
        given below.
        
        First login to https://archive.gemini.edu with your archive account. Associate your account
        to programs with proprietary data using the program key provided to the PI. See the GOA
        [help page](https://archive.gemini.edu/help/index.html) for more details.

        2) Click "Show Web Inspector" in the Develop menu.
        3) Select Cookies in the Storage tab. The cookie you need is called gemini_archive_session.

        Copy the value of the cookie and store it in a hidden file called <path>/.goa_auth.
        By default get_goa_authority assumes that this is in the home directory, but the path (keydir)
        can be specified.
