# This test case calculates the phase retardation that is introduced
# by a weak dielectric sphere to an incident plane wave. Only the
# x-polarized light is considered.

# Note: This example computes the phase behind the sphere. In microscopy,
# the focal plane during imaging is close to the center of the sphere.
# To compute the phase image that corresponds to that imaged with a focal
# plane at the center of the bead, numerical refocusing of the computed
# field `Ex` would be required (e.g. python package nrefocus).
