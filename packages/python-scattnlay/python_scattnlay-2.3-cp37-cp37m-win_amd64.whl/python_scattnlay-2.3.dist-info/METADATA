The Python version of scattnlay, a computer implementation of the algorithm for the calculation of electromagnetic radiation scattering by a multilayered sphere developed by Yang. It has been shown that the program is effective, resulting in very accurate values of scattering efficiencies for a wide range of size parameters, which is a considerable improvement over previous implementations of similar algorithms.
