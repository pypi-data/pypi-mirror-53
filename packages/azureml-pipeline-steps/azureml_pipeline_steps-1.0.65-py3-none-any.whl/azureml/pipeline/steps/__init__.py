"""Contains pre-built steps that can be executed in an Azure Machine Learning Pipeline.

Azure ML Pipeline steps can be configured together to construct a Pipeline, which represents a shareable
and reusable Azure Machine Learning workflow. Each step of a pipeline can be configured to allow reuse of
its previous run results if the step contents (scripts and dependencies) as well as inputs and parameters
remain unchanged.

The pre-built steps in this package cover many common scenarios encountered in machine
learning workflows. To get started with pre-built pipeline steps, see the Jupyter notebook
https://aka.ms/pl-first-pipeline or see the article [Create ML pipelines in
Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-create-your-first-pipeline)
in the Azure Machine Learning documentation.
