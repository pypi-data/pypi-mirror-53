0.4
---
- create_many() checks whether schema has been installed

0.35
----
- fix manifest to properly include paster template
- remove unnecessary argparse dependency

0.34
----
- add `paster create -t stucco_evolution mypackage` to create an evolution
  module in `mypackage/evolve/...`

0.33
----
- Backwards-incompatible change. A SQLAlchemy connection is now required
  everywhere a session was previously expected.
  This is necessary for transactional DDL (the ability to roll back a
  migration that throws an exception.)

0.12
----
- Add create_or_upgrade_packages(session, 'packagename') convenience function

0.11
----
- Backwards-incompatible API changes
- Improve documentation
- Detect circular dependencies between evolution modules
- Regain 100% statement coverage (however, unit tests depend on several
  unreleased packages)

0.10
----
- Add multi-package schema evolution support with DAG-ordered dependencies

0.9
---

- Rename to stucco_evolution
- stucco_evolution's own upgrade() will now deletage all
  stucco_evolution.Base.metadata.create_all(session) to the evolveN.py
  scripts. This avoids 'DROP TABLE' statements when an upgrade includes
  table renames.

0.8998
------

- Improved packageability (MANIFEST.in specified)
- SQLAlchemyEvolutionManager no longer calls session.commit(); this is
  your responsibility after the migration has completed.
