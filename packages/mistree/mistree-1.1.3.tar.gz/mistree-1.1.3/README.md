## Introduction

The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) has been used in a broad range of scientific research including computer science, epidemiology, social sciences, particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. Its success in these field has been driven by its sensitivity to the spatial distribution of points and the patterns within. MiSTree, a public Python package, allows a user to construct the MST in a variety of coordinates systems, including Celestial coordinates used in astronomy. The package enables the MST to be constructed quickly by initially using a k-nearest neighbour graph (rather than a matrix of pairwise distances) which is then fed to Kruskal's algorithm to construct the MST. MiSTree enables a user to measure the statistics of the MST and provides classes for binning the MST statistics (into histograms) and plotting the distributions. Including the MST in cosmological parameter estimation studies will enable the inclusion of high-order statistics information from the cosmic web. This information has traditionally been unexploited due to the computational cost of calculating N-point statistics.

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7 or 3.4+
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `f2py` (should be installed with numpy)

## Installation

MiSTree can be installed as follows:

```
pip install mistree [--user]
```

The `--user` is optional and only required if you donâ€™t have write permission. If you
want to work on the Github version you can clone the repository and install an editable version:

```
git clone https://github.com/knaidoo29/mistree.git
cd mistree
pip install -e . [--user]
```

You should now be able to import the module:

```python
import mistree as mist
```
