Additionally, it has the broader goal to become the most\nuseful and flexible open sourced tool for financial data analysis available in\npopular programming languages.\n\nApplications\n============\n\nUseful applications of ``cifrum`` in the community developed are as follows:\n\n* Fully-functional ``Angular2+``-based web-application `okama.io`_\n* `tell us more <okama-discourse_>`_ if you know any\n\nThe Ecosystem\n=============\n\nThe ecosystem around the library consists of:\n\n* The Python package\n* Financial and Economic data for several markets\n* ``Angular2+`` web-application `okama.io`_\n* `Financial terms glossary <okama-glossary_>`_\n* `The community <okama-discourse_>`_\n\nMain Features\n=============\n\n* ``[x]`` ``TimeSeries`` to verify correctness of financial data manipulations\n* ``[x]`` Error-free manipulations with financial data checked by tests and active community\n* ``[x]`` Asset analysis tools for asset correlations and main performance indicators\n* ``[ ]`` Portfolio analysis tools for asset class allocation and portfolio backtesting\n* ``[ ]`` Portfolio optimization and efficient frontier visualization\n* ``[ ]`` Monte Carlo Simulation for financial assets and investment portfolios\n* ``[ ]`` Bonds key properties calculations\n* ``[x]`` Access to financial data from different stock markets: EOD close, adjusted close, currency rates, inflation\n* ``[x]`` Financial and Economic data with API with GraphQL data access\n\nFinancial and Economic data freely available\n============================================\n* ``[x]`` EOD adjusted close for NYSE and NASDAQ stocks and ETF\n* ``[x]`` EOD close for Moscow Exchange stocks and ETF\n* ``[x]`` EOD close for Russian open-end funds\n* ``[ ]`` EOD close for BSE and NSE stocks and ETF (India)\n* ``[x]`` EOD for main stock and bond Indexes\n* ``[ ]`` Bonds data for Moscow Exchange-traded securities: EOD close, coupons, maturity\n* ``[x]`` Exchange Rates for USD, EUR, RUB\n* ``[ ]`` Exchange Rates for Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], Binance Coin [BNB] and other cryptocurrencies\n* ``[x]`` Inflation for US, EU, and Russia\n* ``[x]`` Key interest rates for US, EU, and Russia\n* ``[x]`` History of deposit rates for top 10 banks of Russia\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe library is published to `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/project/cifrum/>`_.\n\nInstall stable version:\n\n.. code :: bash\n\n    pip install -U cifrum\n\n\nInstall development version:\n\n.. code :: bash\n\n    pip install -U git+https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum.git\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\n=================\n\nThe `examples <https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum/tree/master/examples>`_ folder contains Jupyter notebooks\nthat show how to use the library parts in depth.\n\n`examples <https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum/tree/master/examples>`_ are also compatible with\nbinder. You can try it by pressing the |Binder|_ button.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nThe library dependencies are listed at\n`pyproject.toml <https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum/blob/master/pyproject.toml>`_ under\n``[tool.poetry.dependencies]`` section.\n\nDiscussion, Development, and Getting Help\n=========================================\n\n- The development discussion takes place at `the GitHub repo\n  <cifrum-github-issues_>`_. We encourage you to report issues using `the Github\n  tracker <cifrum-github-issues_>`_. We welcome all kinds of issues related to\n  correctness, documentation, performance, and feature requests.\n- `The community forum <okama-discourse_>`_ can also be used for general\n  questions and discussions.\n- Finally, the `Gitter channel <Gitter_>`_ is available for the development\n  related questions.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements,\nenhancements, frontend implementation, and ideas are welcomed and the subject\nto discuss. Simple ways to start contributing immediately:\n\n- Browse the issue tracker to find issues that interest you\n- Read the source code and improve the documentation or address TODOs\n- Improve the example library and tutorials\n- Bug reports are an important part of making the library more stable\n- Run the library through `the okama.io frontend <okama.io_>`_ and suggest\n  improvements in design, UI, and functionality\n\nThe code is hosted at `GitHub <cifrum-github_>`_. You need an GitHub account\nwhich is free to contribute to the project. We use git for the version control\nto enable distributed work on the project.\n\nContributions should be submitted as a pull request. A member of the\ndevelopment team will review the pull request and guide you through the\ncontributing process.\n\nFeel free to ask questions at `the community <okama-discourse_>`_.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n`GPL <license_>`_\n\n.. |--| unicode:: U+2013\n.. _okama.io: https://okama.io/\n.. _okama-glossary: https://okama.io/#/glossary\n.. _okama-discourse: http://community.okama.io\n.. _cifrum-github: https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum\n.. _cifrum-github-issues: https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum/issues\n.. _license: https://github.com/okama-io/cifrum/blob/master/LICENSE\n',
