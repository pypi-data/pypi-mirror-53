Prefer to do simple\nthings in a terminal?\n\nThen **brew-tools** is for you.\n\nCurrently brew-tools includes:\n\n-  ABV calculator\n-  Keg priming calculator\n-  Priming sugar calculator\n-  Quick infusion calculator\n-  Adjust gravity with dme calculator\n-  Apparent and Real attenuation calculator\n-  Final gravity from a given attenuation percentage\n-  Gravity adjustment by boil off/dilution calculator\n-  New gravity after volume adjustment\n\nMore to come\n\nSee the `changelog <CHANGELOG.rst>`__ for updates in each version\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBrew-tools is available from PyPI\n\n::\n\n    pip install brew-tools\n\nYou can also clone/download this repository and install it using pip\n\n::\n\n    cd <brew-tools-dir>\n    pip install .\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nBrew tools has built in help\n\n::\n\n    Usage: brew-tools [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n    Options:\n    --version  Show the version and exit.\n    -imperial  Use imperial units.

The current version of brew-tools uses [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)\nto manage virtual environments and such.\n\nIn order to start, [install Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/#installation)\nand change into the brew-tools directory. From there you can run\n\n::\n\n    poetry install\n\nwhich will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.\nTo run `brew_tools` in the developmeent environment it's probably easiest to run\n\n::\n\n    poetry shell\n\nwhich will spawn a configured shell for the environment.\n\nTests can be run in this environment, or you can use\n\n::\n\n   poetry run pytest tests\n\nto run the tests without spawning a shell.\n\nIn addition to the tests it's advisable to run a linter of the source as Travis\nwill also check for linting errors. The linter command ignores some errors, so you\ncan use this command to match the command run by Travis\n\n::\n\n    poetry run flake8 src --ignore=E501,W504,W503\n\nThanks\n======\n\nThanks to\n\n-  /u/DAMNIT\\_REZNO - for inspiring me to start this project\n-  SlayterDev - DME addition calculator\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nBrew Tools is released under the MIT license.\n\nSee ``LICENSE.txt`` for more details\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.com/Svenito/brew-tools.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.com/Svenito/brew-tools\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/brew-tools/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: https://brew-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n.. |PyPI version| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/brew-tools.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/brew-tools\n",
