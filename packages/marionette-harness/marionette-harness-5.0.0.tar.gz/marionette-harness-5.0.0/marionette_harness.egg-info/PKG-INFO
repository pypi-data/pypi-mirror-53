Description: marionette-harness
        ==================
        
        Marionette is an automation driver for Mozilla's Gecko engine. It can remotely
        control either the UI or the internal JavaScript of a Gecko platform, such as
        Firefox. It can control both the chrome (i.e. menus and functions) or the
        content (the webpage loaded inside the browsing context), giving a high level
        of control and ability to replicate user actions. In addition to performing
        actions on the browser, Marionette can also read the properties and attributes
        of the DOM.
        
        The marionette_harness package contains the test runner for Marionette, and
        allows you to run automated tests written in Python for Gecko based
        applications. Therefore it offers the necessary testcase classes, which are
        based on the unittest framework.
