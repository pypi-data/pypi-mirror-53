This module contains the SerialPseudoSocket class. This
is a specialized serial device class that provides a
(minimal) socket-like interface, so that it can be used
in place of a socket for applications that expect one.
An example of this usage is the SerialTelnet class in
this sub-package, which uses this class as a simple
"drop-in" replacement for the Python standard library
``socket`` class to implement a telnet client that can
communicate over a serial port.
