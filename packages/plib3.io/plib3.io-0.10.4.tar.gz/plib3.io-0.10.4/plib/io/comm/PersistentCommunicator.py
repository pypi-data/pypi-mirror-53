class PersistentCommunicator(BaseCommunicator):
    """Communicator class specialized for persistent I/O.
    
    Class for both client and server side communicators that want
    to maintain a persistent, full-duplex connection--i.e., instead
    of a write/read or read/write loop and then a check for done,
    always be ready to read, and write whenever you have something
    to write, and never being "done" by default (you have to explicitly
    call ``finish`` from inside the communication loop, or ``close``
    from outside it, to tell the loop that it is done). Expects
    a class earlier in the MRO to implement the ``start``,
    ``handle_read``, ``handle_write``, ``read_complete``,
    ``write_complete``, ``clear_read``, and ``clear_write`` methods;
    the intent is that this will be ``BaseData`` or a class derived
    from it.
    
    Note that, because reads and writes may overlap, this class also
    implements a simple queue for write data to ensure that all data
    gets written in the correct order and none is clobbered; to make this
    work, a class earlier in the MRO must also implement the ``start``
    method, which should enable the actual transfer of a single item of
    data. Also, the ``reading`` and ``writing`` fields are added to
    ensure that once a read or write is started, it must complete
    before another operation can start.
