This module contains the BaseCommunicator class, a base class that
implements common baseline communication functionality for all
I/O modes (serial vs. socket, blocking/synchronous vs.
non-blocking/asynchronous, etc.). This class assumes that a
subclass of ``BaseData`` is earlier in the MRO, so that all
of the methods implemented in that class can be accessed via
super calls.

class BaseCommunicator(object):
    """Base class for managing a communication channel.
    
    Two key concepts are encoded in this class:
    
    - A "channel" is a communication link between an instance
      of this class and another endpoint.
    
    - A "communication loop" is a specific exchange of data
      over the channel (not necessarily a single round trip, but
      a single "exchange" conceptually--e.g., a "handshaking"
      protocol may require multiple round trips, but conceptually
      it is a single exchange).
    
    The two are not necessarily the same: the channel may stay
    alive over multiple communication loops with the same remote
    endpoint (this is what the ``keep_alive`` flag determines).
    The key thing with the communication loop is that while it is
    running, it controls program execution; whatever user code
    started it will not be returned control until it finishes.
    (User code may run in event handlers that are triggered, e.g.,
    when a server accepts a new connection, or when received data
    is ready to be processed; but those handlers must always
    return control to the communication loop.) In practice, as
    will be seen below, most of the time the lifetime of the
    channel and the communication loop is the same, but they
    should be kept conceptually distinct.
    
    Derived classes from this one will be one of three types; it
    should be noted that only with the second of the three (clients)
    is there an actual separation in practice between the lifetime
    of the communication loop and the channel.
    
    - Server-side communicators: These are request handlers or
      servers that only have one channel at a time (e.g., serial
      servers). If they do not shut down the connection after a
      single round-trip data exchange (as, for example, a simple
      HTTP server might do), their communication loop is entirely
      controlled by the client (i.e., it only exits when the client
      closes the connection). Either way, the lifetime of their
      communication loop is the same as that of the channel.
    
    - Client-side communicators: These open channels to servers,
      do some communicating, then exit. There are three subtypes
      of clients: (1) those that do a single round-trip data
      exchange and exit (the default as the base classes are set
      up); (2) those that may start with multiple data items queued,
      do as many round-trips as they have items queued, and then
      exit (e.g., a message delivery client that talks to a logging
      daemon--it may have one or more messages, but once it has
      delivered them all and received acknowledgement, it exits);
      (3) those that want to maintain a long-lived connection for
      an unspecified number of data exchanges (e.g., an instant
      messaging client driven by user interaction). It is the third
      type that will have a different lifetime for the communication
      loop and the channel (e.g., each instant message will be one
      communication loop; the loop then has to exit to allow the
      user to input a new message, then start up again, but the
      channel remains open the whole time).
    
    - Persistent communicators: These can be client-side or
      server-side (in which case they basically behave the same as
      clients or servers/request handlers with ``keep_alive`` set
      to ``True``), but the real intended use case for these is for
      enabling multiple long-running server processes to exchange
      messages at arbitrary times and in arbitrary order. Since
      new messages are injected into their communication loops by
      automated means rather than by user interaction, in practice
      the lifetime of the communication loop for these is the same
      as that of the channel.
    
    All communicator classes assume that there is a data handling
    class (intended to be ``BaseData`` or a class derived from it)
    earlier in the MRO, so that the presence of that API can be
    assumed. Communicators will override data handling methods as
    necessary to add the appropriate tracking of the state of the
    channel, making super calls to do the actual data handling.
