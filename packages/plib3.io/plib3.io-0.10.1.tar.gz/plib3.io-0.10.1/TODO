Planned Features
----------------

PLIB3.IO is feature complete at this time.

Bugs/Workaround Fixes
---------------------

- The forking socket server in ``plib.io.blocking``
  doesn't work on Windows. Forking in general on Windows
  is a chancy business, but the basic forking functionality
  in PLIB3 works OK there; it just coughs and dies whenever
  the forking server tries to fork a request handler.
  (Probably it's because the pickler that is used by the
  multiprocessing module to set up the child process is
  being streched too far, since it's trying to pickle the
  entire server context and then unpickle it in the child
  process for the request handler; the multiprocessing
  module was not really designed for that.) Since I don't
  recommend running servers in general on Windows, much
  less forking ones (the threading server in the PLIB3 I/O
  library works OK if you simply *must*), I'm not in a
  hurry to fix all this, but it is a current bug. (All of
  the tests involving the forking server are disabled on
  Windows.)

- Various async I/O tests are failing on Windows, for
  reasons that aren't clear; the basic async I/O functionality
  appears to work (at least when tested using the example
  ``echo_server.py`` and ``chat_server.py`` programs).

- All of the "large message" I/O tests fail on Windows
  (i.e., any test where the message being transferred over
  a socket is larger than the socket buffer size). I
  suspect this is because of subtle differences in socket
  semantics on Windows, but haven't been able to pin it
  down. (Windows advocates may wonder why I'm singling out
  Windows here, but the reason is simple: all of the above
  tests and functionality that has problems or bugs on
  Windows, *just works* on *every* other platform I've
  tested on--various flavors of Linux, Mac OS X, and
  FreeBSD, using various Python 2.x versions--2.4, 2.5, 2.6,
  and 2.7. Windows is the *only* OS that requires all these
  extra gymnastics for what is just basic programming
  everywhere else, and then it *still* doesn't always work.)
