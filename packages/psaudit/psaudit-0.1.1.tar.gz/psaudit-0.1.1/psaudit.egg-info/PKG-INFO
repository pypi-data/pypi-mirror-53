Description: # psaudit
        Process auditor for macOS. Verifies that all running processes have been signed by Apple.
        
        # Installation
        ```
        pip install psaudit
        ```
        
        # Usage
        ```
        psaudit
        ```
        
        If any processes fail the audit, they will be listed and the script will return a non-zero error code indicating the number of failed processes. For example:
        ```
        $ psaudit 
        process 371 (/Applications/Utilities/Adobe Sync/CoreSync/Core Sync.app/Contents/PlugIns/ACCFinderSync.appex/Contents/MacOS/ACCFinderSync) not signed by Apple
        process 14722 (/usr/local/Cellar/bash/5.0.11/bin/bash) not signed by Apple
        process 75508 (/usr/local/Cellar/macvim/8.1-157/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/MacVim) not signed by Apple
        process 75509 (/usr/local/Cellar/macvim/8.1-157/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim) not signed by Apple
        $ echo $?
        4
        ```
