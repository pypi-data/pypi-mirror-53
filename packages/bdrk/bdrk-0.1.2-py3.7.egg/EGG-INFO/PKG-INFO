Description: [Bedrock](https://bedrock.basis-ai.com) helps data scientists own the end-to-end deployment of machine learning workflows. `bdrk` is the official client library for interacting with APIs on Bedrock platform.
        
        ## Usage
        
        In order to use `bdrk`, you need to register an account with Basis AI. Please email `contact@basis-ai.com` to get started. Once an account is created, you will be issued a personal API token that you can use to authenticate with Bedrock.
        
        ### Installing Bedrock client
        
        You can install Bedrock client library from PyPi with the following command. We recommend running it in a virtual environment to prevent potential dependency conflicts.
        
        ```bash
        pip install bdrk
        ```
        
        Note that the client library is officially supported for python 3.7 and above.
        
        #### Installing optional dependencies
        
        The following optional dependencies can be installed to enable additional featues.
        
        Command line support:
        ```bash
        pip install bdrk[cli]
        ```
        
        Feauture Store support:
        ```bash
        pip install bdrk[fs]
        ```
        
        
        ### Setting up your environment
        
        Once installed, you need to add a well formed `bedrock.hcl` configuration file in your project's root directory. The configuration file specifies which script to run for training and deployment as well as their respective base Docker images. You can find an example directory layout [here](https://github.com/basisai/churn_prediction).
        
        When using the module locally, you may need to define the following environment variables for `bdrk` to make API calls to Bedrock. These variables will be automatically set on your workload container when running in cluster.
        
        ```bash
        BEDROCK_API_DOMAIN=https://bedrock.basis-ai.com
        BEDROCK_API_TOKEN=<your personal API token>
        ```
        
        ### Logging training metrics
        
        Using `bdrk` bedrock client, you can easily export training metrics to Bedrock by adding logging code to `train.py`. The example below demonstrates logging charts and metrics for visualisation on Bedrock platform.
        
        ```python
        import logging
        
        from bedrock_client.bedrock.api import BedrockApi
        
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        bedrock = BedrockApi(logger)
        bedrock.log_metric("Accuracy", 0.97)
        bedrock.log_chart_data([0, 1, 2, 3], [0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])
        ```
