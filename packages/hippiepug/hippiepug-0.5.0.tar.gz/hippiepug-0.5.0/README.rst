This library provides implementations of two cryptographic data structures:

- Blockchains with log(n) sublinear traversal, implemented as high-integrity
  deterministic skip-lists (skipchains). In this kind of blockchain verifying
  that block *b* extends block *a* does not require to download and process
  all blocks between *a* and *b*, but only a logarithmic amount of them.
- Verifiable dictionary, implemented as a key-value Merkle tree that
  guarantees unique resolution. A proof of inclusion of a key-value pair in
  such a tree also proves that there does not exist another value for a given
  key somewhere else in the tree.

Both are meant to be used with a content-addressable storage. Each data
structure supports logarithmic queries, and logarithmic proofs of inclusion:

+-----------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+----------------+
|                       | Retrievals per lookup    | Inclusion proof size | Append         |
+=======================+==========================+======================+================+
| Skipchain             | O(log(n))                | O(log(n))            | O(1)           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+----------------+
| Key-value Merkle tree | O(log(n))                | O(log(n))            | Immutable      |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+----------------+

with *n* being the size of the dictionary, or the number of blocks in the
case of a chain.

The theoretical details are in the `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06279>`_.
