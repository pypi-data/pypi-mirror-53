# Bionic

Bionic is a Python framework for building, running, and sharing data science
research workflows.  It uses dependency injection to automatically gather
together your Python functions into a reusable, configurable tool.

Bionic is currently in alpha.  It is suitable for small-to-medium-size research
projects: i.e., projects that fit in memory, have a small number of
collaborators, and are intended to generate insight or some data artifact (like
a model) rather than run in production.  (These constraints will be eliminated
over time.)  The API will continue to evolve; we will attempt to keep it
backwards-compatible as long as possible, but there will probably be at least
one breaking API change in the future.

Check out the [full documentation](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
or go straight to [Get
Started](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started.html).

## Installation

Bionic can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install bionic[standard]

You'll probably want to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as well.
See the [Installation
docs](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started.html#installation)
for more details on installing and configuring Bionic's dependencies.
