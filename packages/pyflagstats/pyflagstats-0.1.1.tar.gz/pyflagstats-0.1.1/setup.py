    long_description="""
Given a stream of k$bit words, we seek to sum the bit values at indexes 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1 across multiple words 
by computing k distinct sums. If the k-bit words are one-hot encoded then the sums corresponds to their frequencies.

This multiple-sum problem is a generalization of the population-count 
problem where we count the total number of set bits in independent machine words.
We refer to this new problem as the positional population-count problem.

Using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions from 
recent Intel processors, we describe algorithms for computing the 16-bit position population count using about one eighth (0.125) 
of a CPU cycle per 16-bit word. Our best approach is about 140-fold faster than competitive code using only non-SIMD instructions in terms of CPU cycles.

This package contains the application of the efficient positional population count operator to computing summary statistics for the SAM FLAG field.""",
