  The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
  but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor.
  So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
  -- Genesis 4:4-5 (NIV)

  Each minute bursts in the burning room,   
  The great globe reels in the solar fire,   
  Spinning the trivial and unique away.
  (How all things flash! How all things flare!)   
  What am I now that I was then?   
  May memory restore again and again   
  The smallest color of the smallest day:   
  Time is the school in which we learn,   
  Time is the fire in which we burn.
  -- Calmly We Walk through This Aprilâ€™s Day
