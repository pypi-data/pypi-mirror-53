# MongoDB Atlas - A Python API for MongoDB Atlas

The MongoDB database as a service offering [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) provides
a complete and well documented [REST API](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/).

## Installation

The Python Atlas API wraps the REST API in a more Pythonic
API based around an ``AtlasAPI`` class. 

The library assumes the existence of two environment variables:

* `ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY` : The public key value defined by the 
[Atlas programmatic API key](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys)
* `ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY` : The private key defined by the Atlas programmatic API
key.

## How to create an Atlas API Key
You can create keys at the Organization level by selecting the access menu item 
on the left hand side menu:

Once you create a key you then need to assign it permissions. If you pick the 
default youwill have to add this key explicitly to every project that you want 
to manage via the API.

![API Permissions Screen ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdrumgoole/atlasapi/master/images/api-key-permissions.png)

On the next screen you can collect your API key. You will only get to see it
once so please make sure to take a copy.

Finally you need to whitelist any nodes that are going to originate API requests.
