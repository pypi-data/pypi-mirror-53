The Python-language Emailageâ„¢ API client helps companies integrate with our highly efficient fraud risk and scoring system.
By calling our API endpoints and simply passing us an email and/or IP Address, companies will be provided with real-time risk scoring assessments based around machine learning and proprietary algorithms that evolve with new fraud trends.

Typical usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instantiate a client


.. code:: python

    from emailage.client import EmailageClient
    # For a production server
    emailage = EmailageClient('My account SID', 'My auth token')
    # ... or for a sandbox
    emailage = EmailageClient('My account SID', 'My auth token', sandbox=True)

Query risk score information for the provided email address, IP address, or a combination
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    # For an email address
    emailage.query('test@example.com')
    # For an IP address
    emailage.query('127.0.0.1')
    # For a combination. Please note the order
    emailage.query(('test@example.com', '127.0.0.1'))
    # Pass a User Defined Record ID (URID).
    # Can be used when you want to add an identifier for a query.
    # The identifier will be displayed in the result.
    emailage.query('test@example.com', urid='My record ID for test@example.com')

For ease of use, explictly-named methods are provided as well.

.. code:: python

    # For an email address
    emailage.query_email('test@example.com')
    # For an IP address
    emailage.query_ip_address('127.0.0.1')
    # For a combination. Please note the order
    emailage.query_email_and_ip_address('test@example.com', '127.0.0.1')
    # Pass a User Defined Record ID
    emailage.query_email_and_ip_address('test@example.com', '127.0.0.1', urid='My record ID for test@example.com and 127.0.0.1')


Mark an email address as fraud, good, or neutral
------------------------------------------------

You may report that you have found that an email address is good, is associated with fraud, or neither (neutral).

The call to flag an email address as fraud _must_ be accompanied by the fraud reason ID.
The IDs and descriptions are enumerated below:

| 1 - Card Not Present Fraud
| 2 - Customer Dispute (Chargeback)
| 3 - First Party Fraud
| 4 - First Payment Default
| 5 - Identify Theft (Fraud Application)
| 6 - Identify Theft (Account Take Over)
| 7 - Suspected Fraud (Not Confirmed)
| 8 - Synthetic ID
| 9 - Other

.. code:: python

    # Mark an email address as fraud because of Synthetic ID.
    emailage.flag('fraud', 'test@example.com', 8)
    emailage.flag_as_fraud('test@example.com', 8)
    # Mark an email address as good.
    emailage.flag('good', 'test@example.com')
    emailage.flag_as_good('test@example.com')
    # Unflag an email address that was previously marked as good or fraud.
    emailage.flag('neutral', 'test@example.com')
    emailage.flag_as_neutral('test@example.com')
