Acknowledge
-----------

We included source code with minor changes from [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) by Ricky Chen,
because of two purpose:
1. package torchdiffeq is not indexed by pypi
2. package torchdiffeq is very convenient and mandatory

All our contribution is based on Ricky's Neural ODE paper (NIPS 2018) and his package.
