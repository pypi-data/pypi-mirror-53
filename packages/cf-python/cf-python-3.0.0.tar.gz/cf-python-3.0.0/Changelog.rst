version 3.0.0 (*first Python 3 version*)
----------------------------------------
----

**2019-10-01**

* Complete refactor for Python 3, including some API changes.

  Scripts written for version 2.x but running under version 3.x should
  either work as expected, or provide informative error mesages on the
  new API usage. However, it is advised that the outputs of older
  scripts be checked when running with Python 3 versions of the cf
  library.

version 2.3.5 (*last Python 2 version*)
---------------------------------------
----

**2019-04-04**

* Changed calculation of chunksize in parallel case to avoid potential
  problems and introduced a new method `cf.SET_PERFORMANCE` to tune
  the chunksize and the fraction of memory to keep free.

version 2.3.4
-------------
----

**2019-03-27**

* Fix bug in creating a during cell method during a field
  collapse.
	
version 2.3.3
-------------
----

**2019-03-05**

* Allow failure to compile to go through with a warning, rather
  than failing to install. if this happens, reading a PP/UM file
  will result in "Exception: Can't determine format of file
  test2.pp"
* Fixed bug in Field.convolution_filter giving false error over units.
	
version 2.3.2
-------------
----

**2018-12-10**

* `cf.Field.regridc` now compares the units of the source and
  destination grids and converts between them if possible or raises an
  error if they are not equivalent.
	
version 2.3.1
-------------
----

**2018-11-07**

* Fixed bug in `cf.Field.regridc` that caused it to fail when
  regridding a multidimensional field along only one dimension.
* Fixed bug which in which the default logarithm is base 10, rather
  than base e
	
version 2.3.0
-------------
----

**2018-10-22**

* The collapse method can now be parallelised by running any
  cf-python script with mpirun if mpi4py is installed. This is an
  experimental feature and is not recommended for operational
  use. None of the parallel code is executed when a script is run in
  serial.
	
version 2.2.8
-------------
----

**2018-08-28**

* Bug fix: better handle subspacing by multiple multidimensional
  items
	
version 2.2.7
-------------
----

**2018-07-25**

  inserted with insert_bounds has units of ''. In this case the
  bounds of the parent coordinate are now inherited.
	
version 2.2.6
-------------
----

**2018-07-24**

  'Field' and 'Grid' becomes 'Space'.
* Field aggregation using the CF aggregation rules is available when
  reading fields from disk and on fields in memory. The data of a
  field resulting from aggregation are stored as a collection of the
  data from the component fields and so, as before, may be file
  pointers, arrays in memory or a mixture of these two forms.
* Units, missing data flags, dimension order, dimension direction and
  packing flags may all be different between data components and are
  conformed at the time of data access.

  interpret and manipulate the data. This will be particularly useful
  when data arrays spanning many files/arrays is implemented

  Jeff Whitaker).
