# Version number of this configuration file:
# When changing the version number, make sure it matches the version number 
# in the "/vdms_SYS/ctrl_run.py" file on the "check videomass.conf and 
# configuration folder" section. This will automatically restore the current 
# version of the configuration file in the user conf. directory
1.6

# Version number of the .vdms file presets:
0.5

# FFmpeg always has one main thread which does most of the processing. 
# In case of multiple inputs there are also input threads for demuxing 
# (1 thread per input); for single input demuxing is done on main thread. 
# Setting "threads N" (where N > 1) on input enables multithreaded decoding 
# which can spawn N additional threads for each decoder which supports it.
# Set the number of threads (from 0 to 32), default 1:
-threads 4

#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
# !! WARNING !! LOGLEVEL OPTION ffplay/ffmpeg: 
# All FFmpeg output messages are on stderr (excluse ffprobe), and include 
# both information messages and error messages. Videomass does its best to 
# capture the output and log only the output by ffmpeg that is made available 
# by 'loglevel' type option.
# Changing the following logging level would also change the behavior of 
# the output on log messages and error messages.

# Set loglevel option for FFplay:
# the 'hide_banner' option is used to limit the output that might be 
# excessive in a window.
error -hide_banner

# Set loglevel option for FFmpeg:
# Very important: the -stats option print progress report during encoding, 
# useful for the progress bar and the percentage progress label. 
# Changing the -stats option, Videomass would not work correctly.
# Note that in some cases the -stats option is excluded when a process 
# reading is not required.
warning -stats -hide_banner
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#

# EXECUTABLES BINARY:
# Videomass support custom executables links of FFmpeg, FFprobe and FFplay 
# binaries. These links refer to paths managed by users who want to use 
# other versions of FFmpeg in their user-space. If these options are not 
# used, videomass will use executables installed in the system by default

# Activation FFmpeg executable (boolean values = true/false):
