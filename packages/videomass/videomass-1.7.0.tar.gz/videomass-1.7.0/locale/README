NOTE TO TRASLATORS:

To start a new translation, clone my repo by type:

git clone https://gitlab.com/jeanslack/Videomass.git

create two new folders inside /Videomass/locale folder (for example create
a 'de_DE' folder and within which a 'LC_MESSAGES' folder for the German 
language support) with the following tree:

    /Videomass
        /locale
            /de_DE
                /LC_MESSAGES
            
Copy the "videomass.pot" file translation template located in the '/locale' 
folder, and paste into the 'LC_MESSAGES' folder, than rename it to change
extension name to "videomass.po". 
Now open the "videomass.po" with a translation editing program, for example 
'Poedit', and then save it by generating a 'videomass.mo' file with your 
new native language tanslation.

Optionally, if you want to try your new translation by starting Videomass, 
make sure to update the "videomass2/vdms_SYS/app_const.py" module for 
Python2 and "videomass3/vdms_SYS/app_const.py" module for Python3 by adding 
the newly translated language to the dictionary on 'app_const.py', for 
example appending this line:

    u "de": wx.LANGUAGE_GERMAN,
    
to:

    supLang = {u "en": wx.LANGUAGE_ENGLISH,
               u "it": wx.LANGUAGE_ITALIAN,
               u "de": wx.LANGUAGE_GERMAN,
               }

For a list of the supported languages, please see:
https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/wx.Language.enumeration.html#wx-language

--------------

When you have completed your translation with 'Poedit', please send me the
traslated files with 'videomass.po' and 'videomass.mo' extensions at:

<jeanlucperni@gmail.com>

I will be grateful!!
