Description: plot
        ========
        This is a command line package for using matplotlib
        to make plots based on input JSON or YAML file.
        
        Examples
        =========
        This package is still in active development.  
        For examples, you can take a look at the [test/run](https://github.com/yuhangwang/plot/tree/master/test/run) folder.
        Currently `plot` supports plotting `line`, `bar`, `matrix` and `span` plots.
        The full list of available parameters can be found in the [plot/parameter](https://github.com/yuhangwang/plot/tree/master/plot/parameter) folder.  
        In the subfolders: `data`, `global` and `local`,
        the `all.yaml` contains all the parameters for each these fields.
        It is automatically generated using the the individual yaml files,  
        such as `bar.yaml`, `line.yaml`, etc.
        A documentation will be available soon.
