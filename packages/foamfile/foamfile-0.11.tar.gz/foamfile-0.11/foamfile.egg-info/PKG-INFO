Description: File parser for OpenFOAM configuration files based on <https://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/v6-basic-file-format/>
        
        foamfile uses [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/) to extract the data from the files.
        
        ### example usage
        ```python
        from foamfile import FoamFile
        
        with FoamFile("path/to/file") as f:
            foam_content = f.read()
            print(f.header)
            print(foam_content)
        
        with FoamFile("path/to/file", "w", foam_class="dictionary") as f:
            f.write(foam_content)
        ```
        
        ### TODO
        * Macro expansion does not work at the moment
        * Optimize parsing of directives
        * Add codeStreams
        * Add calculations
        * Add support for comments
        
        Tested with OpenFOAM v6.
