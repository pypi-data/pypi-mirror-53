Description: # Recent
        
        Recent is a more structured way to log your bash history.
        
        The standard `~/.bash_history` file is inadequate in many ways, its
        worst fault is to by default log only 500 history entries, with no timestamp.
        You can alter your bash `HISTFILESIZE` and `HISTTIMEFORMAT` variables but it
        is still a unstructured format with limited querying ability.
        
        Recent does the following.
        
        1. Logs current localtime, command text, current pid, command return value,
           working directory to an sqlite database in `~/.recent.db`.
        2. Logs history immediately, rather than at the close of the session.
        3. Provides a command called `recent` for searching bash history.
        
        ## NOTE about [trengrj/recent](https://github.com/trengrj/recent)
        `recent2` is a clone of [trengrj/recent](https://github.com/trengrj/recent). I
        used [trengrj](https://github.com/trengrj)'s util for about a month and I really
        liked it. However I saw some short comings in the tool. I made a clone because
        trengrj has not been very responsive. 
        
        Most of the code is written by [trengrj](https://github.com/trengrj). I only added
        a few incremental patches; but I intend to actively maintain this as I see more
        interesting use cases.
        
        ## Installation instructions
        
        You need will need sqlite installed.
        
        Install the recent pip package.
        
        `pip install recent2`
        
        Add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.
        
        `export PROMPT_COMMAND='log-recent -r $? -c "$(HISTTIMEFORMAT= history 1)" -p $$'`
        
        And start a new shell.
        
        ## Usage
        
        See example usage at https://asciinema.org/a/271533
        
        Look at your current history using recent. Here are some examples on how to use recent.
        
        ```sh
        # Help
        recent -h
        # Look for all git commands
        recent git
        # Look for git commit commands.
        # Query via regexp mode.
        recent -re git.*commit
        # Look for git commands that are not commits.
        # Query via sql mode.
        recent -sql 'command like "%git%" and command not like "%commit%"'
        ```
        
        By default `recent` commands are not displayed in the output. To see the `recent` commands pass
        the `return_self` argument as follows.
        
        `recent git --return_self`
        
        For more information run `recent -h`
        
        You can directly query your history running `sqlite3 ~/.recent.db "select * from commands limit 10"`
