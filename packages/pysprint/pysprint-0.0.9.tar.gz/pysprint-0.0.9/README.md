Spectrally Refined Interferometry for Python 

CURRENT RELEASE: 0.0.8 (ALPHA)

PySprint is a UI and API for interferogram evaluation. Under construction.
I will add an advanced description later on. 

### Lastest upgrades:
  - Uploaded to PyPI, now pip installable
  - Code Climate + Codecov 
  - Data editing features unittests done
  - API skeleton is done
  - Added CI along with some unittests
  - Started API
  - Numerous little fixes according to PEP8
  - Added autofit for CFF method, it will be improved later
  - Eval. methods are improved
  - Windows remember their last state, they open as they were closed
  - Added Settings panel for calibration
  - Added SPP Panel

### Known issues
* SPP Panel data storage should be rewritten
* Evaluation methods improvement
* The data loading AI sometimes produces unexpected results
* There might be unnecessary imports
* Some buttons has no effect yet.


### To-do list

* ERROR HANDLING!
* Unittests
* Selectable units
* Possible performance enhancement by improving algorithms
* Possible new data manipulating features + new options for existing ones


### Installation

```sh
$ pip install pysprint
```

PySprint requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

Package requirements:
* TO USE THE UI, PLEASE MANUALLY INSTALL : [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
```sh
$ pip install PyQt5
```
or 
```sh
conda install -c dsdale24 pyqt5
```
* numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, lmfit will be automatically collected.


## To Run the GUI
```sh
from pysprint.main import main

main()
```
