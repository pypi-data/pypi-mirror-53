An augmenting path is simply a path from S to T in residual network whose purpose is to increase the flow.

Make graphs, the residual ones will have backward edges everytime flow is added to capacity of a path okay.
the forward edge will have original value-flow added while backward will have the flow added.
when no more edges can be added stop.
add the minimums at the end to find the full graph
