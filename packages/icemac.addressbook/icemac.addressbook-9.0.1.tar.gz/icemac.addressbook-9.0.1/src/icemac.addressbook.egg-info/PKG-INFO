        Change log
        ==========
        
        9.0.1 (2019-10-04)
        ==================
        
        - Update to a trollius version which is still on PyPI.
        
        
        9.0 (2019-09-27)
        ================
        
        Backwards incompatible changes
        ------------------------------
        
        - Drop support for `Manual package installation` which was deprecated since
          version 6.0. If you are still using it, switch to
          `Guided package installation` as described in `Upgrade installation`_.
        
        - Integrate `src/icemac/addressbook/base.zcml` into
          `src/icemac/addressbook/roles.zcml`.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add a search result handler which renders a birthday list.
        
        - Add a cron job which does a daily backup of the database.
        
        - Add an archive and the ability to archive persons.
        
          - The archive can only be accessed by one of the two new roles:
        
            + archive visitor -- read only access in the archive
            + archivist -- access to the archive plus ability to un-archive persons
        
          - Archived persons cannot be found using the search abilities of the
            address book.
        
          - Add a search result handler which can move persons to the archive.
        
          - To disable the archive feature see the `archive documentation`_.
        
        - Allow to edit the labels and descriptions of pre-defined fields.
        
        - Document how to uninstall the address book.
        
        - Add ability to deselect tabs in the main menu.
        
        - Users without any roles no longer get HTTP-403 Forbidden but can access a
          minimal part of the application.
        
        Changes in testing
        ------------------
        
        - Switch Selenium tests from Firefox to Chrome by default requiring
          `chromedriver`, but allow to keep using Firefox via an environment variable.
          Details see `documentation`_.
        
        - Drop support for profiling using `z3c.profiler`.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        - Add some `operations tips <https://icemacaddressbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations.html>`_ for the address book.
        
        - Update most libraries needed for the address book to their newest versions.
        
        - Store messages rendered in UI in RAM instead of in ZODB.
        
        - Render URLs of the source code and documentation on the PyPI page.
        
        - Drop reruns of tests.
        
        - Show test failures instantly.
        
        Bug fixes
        =========
        
        - First time installation no longer asks for migration.
        
        - During installation no longer store the admin password in the config file and
          no longer present the password in clear text during update installation.
        
        
        8.0 (2018-10-13)
        ================
        
        Backwards incompatible changes
        ------------------------------
        
        - No longer install test and debugging infrastructure in a production
          environment by default.
        
        - Rename `Apply` button to `Save`.
        
        - Add ZEO server running the database. This requires a different commands to
          start and stop the address book and the database server, see
          `documentation`_.
        
        - Remove scripts which drop into a debugger on an exception and their
          infrastructure (`bin/debug_ajax` and `bin/debug_pdb`).
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        - Update most libraries needed for the address book to their newest versions.
        
        
        7.0.4 (2018-08-05)
        ==================
        
        - No longer show an empty read more URL in the cookie consent banner if no
          data protection URL is set.
        
        - Fix styling issues introduced in version 7.0.
        
        
        7.0.3 (2018-08-04)
        ==================
        
        - Fix contents of created `buildout.cfg`.
        
        
        7.0.2 (2018-08-04)
        ==================
        
        - Fix installation code to work with ``icemac.install.addressbook >= 1.3.1``.
        
        
        7.0.1 (2018-08-04)
        ==================
        
        - No longer use `bootstrap.py` of ``zc.buildout`` during installation as
          it can produce endless loops. Expect `bin/buildout` to be already installed
          via ``virtualenv``.
        
        
        7.0 (2018-08-03)
        ================
        
        Backward incompatible changes
        -----------------------------
        
        - Move function ``.testing.assert_forbidden()`` as a method to
          ``.testing.Browser.assert_forbidden()`` and expect that the user is already
          logged-in thus no longer requiring ``username`` as argument.
        
        - Drop ``.testing.SiteMenu.assert_correct_menu_item_is_tested()``. Use
          ``.testing.SiteMenu.get_menu_item_title_under_test()`` instead and compare
          its result with `menu_item_title`.
        
        - Change license from ZPL to MIT.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add ability to configure the following links during setup. They are shown at
          the bottom of each page:
        
          + imprint
          + data protection declaration
        
        - Add a `schema_name` index to distinguish between entities in the catalog.
        
        - Add an ability to disable `handle_errors` to debug all exception types.
          See https://icemacaddressbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hacking.html
        
        - Add cookie usage consent dialog.
        
        - Add ability to run tests in parallel.
        
        
        User interface
        --------------
        
        - No longer render the form submit buttons on the bottom border of the screen.
          This did not work very well on mobile devices.
        
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Update most libraries needed for the address book to their newest versions.
        
        - Drop dependency on `gocept.selenium` by writing pure `selenium` tests. This
          requires ``geckodriver`` to run the tests. (See documentation about
          `running the tests`_.)
