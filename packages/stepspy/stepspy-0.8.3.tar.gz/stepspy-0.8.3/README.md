## Background

stepspy is a Python module of Simulation Toolkit for Electrical Power Systems (STEPS). It provides wrapper of APIs of STEPS in a dynamic library.

STEPS is a simulation toolkit for powerflow and dynamic simulation of large-scale power systems. It provides detailed models of bus, line, transformer, HVDC, generator, wind turbine generator, load, and fixed shunt. For more information about STEPS, see (https://github.com/changgang/steps).

## Install

### Install stepspy

To install stepspy, you can run the following codes on your computer or server:

```python
python -m pip install stepspy
```

If you want to manually install stepspy, follow the instructions:

1. Go to https://github.com/changgang/steps to download or fork the latest version of STEPS.
2. Go to python/ folder of STEPS, and copy the latest version of stepspy/ to PYTHONPATH/Lib/site-packages/.

### Install dynamic library

After install the stepspy, you still need to compile and install the dynamic library of STEPS.

1. Go to [steps](https://github.com/changgang/steps) to download or fork the latest version of STEPS. The latest version is usually the [work] branch.
2. Compile STEPS into dynamic library following instructions of STEPS.
3, Move the dynamic library of STEPS to stepspy/libsteps/ in the PYTHONPATH/Lib/site-packages/.
4, If the VC runtime is missing, download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable of 32 or 64 bit version.
5, If VC runtime or Mingw Runtime is missing, install vcredit or copy libwinpthread-1.dll from mingw compiler/bin/ to c:/windows/system32 and c:/windows/SysWOW64

Follow README of STEPS if you want to use both serial and parallel library.
