Description: # Basic usage
        
        ## Measure the energy consumption during a function execution
        
        To measure the energy consumed during the execution of the function `fun()` run the following code
        
        	import pyRAPL
        	
        	sensor = pyRAPL.PyRAPL()
        	sensor.record([pyRAPL.Device.PKG, pyRAPL.Device.DRAM])
        	fun()
        	sensor.stop()
        	energy_pkg = sensor.recorded_energy(pyRAPL.Device.PKG)
            energy_dram = sensor.recorded_energy(pyRAPL.Device.DRAM)
