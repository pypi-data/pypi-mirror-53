Description: Sphinx theme based on Solarized colour palette
        ==============================================
        
        This is a `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ theme forked from the builtin
        *Haiku* theme. It uses the colour palette from
        `Solarized <https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/>`_ by Ethan Schoonover.
        
        The overall theme uses the light Solarized variant, with all the code
        sections being displayed through the Python package
        `pygments-style-solarized <https://pypi.org/project/pygments-style-solarized/>`_
        in the dark Solarized variant.
