"""
An example of a prompt_toolkit coroutine and `Future` objects.
Probably you won't need this in your own applications, but it can be helpful
for understanding how the `prompt_toolkit` event loops works.

If you need asynchronous programming in your own application, it could be worth
considering to use asyncio instead. The reason that prompt_toolkit implements
its own event loop is because we still need to support Python 2, but it does
run on top of asyncio as well if needed.
