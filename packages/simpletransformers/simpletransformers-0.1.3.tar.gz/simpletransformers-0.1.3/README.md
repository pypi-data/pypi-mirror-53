# Pytorch-Transformers-Classification


This library is based on the [Pytorch-Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers) library by HuggingFace. Using this library, you can quickly train and evaluate Transformer models.

Visit the [Github page](https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers) for documentation and code.

Please refer to this [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/https-medium-com-chaturangarajapakshe-text-classification-with-transformer-models-d370944b50ca?source=email-6b1e2355088e--writer.postDistributed&sk=f21ffeb66c03a9804572d7063f57c04e) for further information on how this project works.

Please note that the documentation is still being written.

## Setup

### With Conda

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda Package Manager from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Create a new virtual environment and install packages.  
`conda create -n transformers python pandas tqdm jupyter`  
`conda activate transformers`  
If using cuda:  
  `conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch`  
else:  
  `conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch`  
`conda install -c anaconda scipy`  
`conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn`  
`pip install transformers`  
`pip install tensorboardx`  

3. Install simpletransformers.  
`pip install simpletransformers`  

## Usage

### Minimal Start

```
from simpletransformers.model import TransformerModel
import pandas as pd


# Train and Evaluation data needs to be in a Pandas Dataframe of two columns. The first column is the text with type str, and the second column in the label with type int.
train_data = [['Example sentence belonging to class 1', 1], ['Example sentence belonging to class 0', 0]]
train_df = pd.DataFrame(train_data)

eval_data = [['Example eval sentence belonging to class 1', 1], ['Example eval sentence belonging to class 0', 0]]
eval_df = pd.DataFrame(eval_data)

# Create a TransformerModel
model = TransformerModel('roberta', 'roberta-base')

# Train the model
model.train_model(train_df)

# Evaluate the model
result, model_outputs, wrong_predictions = model.eval_model(eval_df)
```

### Current Pretrained Models

The table below shows the currently available model types and their models. You can use any of these by setting the `model_type` and `model_name` in the `args` dictionary. For more information about pretrained models, see [HuggingFace docs](https://huggingface.co/pytorch-transformers/pretrained_models.html).
