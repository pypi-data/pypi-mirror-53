# ProtonVPN-CLI

![protonvpn-cli](https://i.imgur.com/tDrwkX5l.png)

## *Disclaimer*

**!! This is a work in progress and not considered production ready at this stage. Use at your own risk. !!**

### A Linux CLI for ProtonVPN. Written in Python.

ProtonVPN-CLI is a full rewrite of the [bash protonvpn-cli](https://github.com/ProtonVPN/protonvpn-cli/blob/master/protonvpn-cli.sh) in Python to improve readability, speed and reliability as well as add more functionality and features.

## Installation and Updating

*WIP - Likely via PIP*

### Dependencies

Required system packages:

* openvpn
* dialog (optional, needed for interactive selection)
* python3.5+
* pip for python3 (pip3)

On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:

`sudo dnf install -y openvpn dialog python3-pip`

On Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint and derivatives:

`sudo apt install -y openvpn dialog python3-pip`

On Arch/Manjaro:

`sudo pacman -S openvpn dialog`

### CLI Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file

    `git clone https://github.com/protonvpn/protonvpn-cli-ng`

    or

    `unzip protonvpn-cli-ng-master.zip`

2. Step into the directory

   `cd protonvpn-cli-ng`

3. Install (make sure to use sudo to install globally)

    `sudo setup.py install`

## How to use

You can see a full set of commands and examples by running `protonvpn --help`.

**Most of the commands need to be run as root, so use sudo with the commands in this guide!**

Before using any other commands, you need to initialize your profile:

`protonvpn init`

To connect to a server you always need the `connect` option (or just `c`):

`protonvpn connect`

Running it just like that will give you a menu that let's you select the country, server and protocol interactively:

![server-selection](https://i.imgur.com/jbXP43z.png)

If you specify a servername after connect, you can directly connect to a server of your choice:

`protonvpn connect US-NY#6`

The servername can be written in a few different formats. `usny6`, `us-ny-6`, `usny-06` all work.

To connect to the fastest server, you can use the `--fastest` or `-f` flag:

`protonvpn c --fastest`

`protonvpn c -f`

There's also a flag to connect to a completely random server, `--random` or `-r`:

`protonvpn c -r`

There are a few methods of fastest connect. You can connect to the fastest server of a country, the fastest Secure-Core server, the fastest P2P server or the fastest Tor server.

Fastest server in a country (replace UK with the code of the desired country, e.g. `US` for USA, `JP` for Japan, `AU` for Australia, etc.):

`protonvpn c --cc UK`

Fastest Secure-Core server:

`protonvpn c --sc`

Fastest P2P/torrent server:

`protonvpn c --p2p`

Fastest Tor server:

`protonvpn c --tor`

All connection methods (except the interactive menu) can be used with the `-p` flag to choose a protocol. Possible values are either `TCP` or `UDP` If that flag is not used it will use the default protcol specified in the initialization:

Connect to the fastest server with TCP:

`protonvpn c -f -p TCP`

Connect to a random server with UDP:

`protonvpn c -rp UDP`

To disconnect the VPN, you need to use the `disconnect` or `d` option:

`protonvpn disconnect`

`protonvpn d`

If you're having trouble with your connection, e.g. because you switched networks or your device woke up from sleeping, you can easily reconnect to the last server with the `reconnect` or `r` option:

`protonvpn reconnect`

`protonvpn r`

If you want to see the status and information of your current connection, you can use the `status` or `s` option, which doesn't require root:

`protonvpn status`

`protonvpn s`

![status-example](https://i.imgur.com/RBUG2C3.png)

If you want to change different values that you've set during initialization, you can do this with the `configure` option, just follow the prompts to change your username/password, default protocol and so on:

`protonvpn configure`

Finally, to uninstall protonvpn, use the `uninstall` option. It will entirely remove the program and configuration from your device ðŸ˜”:

`protonvpn uninstall`
