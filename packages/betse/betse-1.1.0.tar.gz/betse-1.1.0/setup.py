#FIXME: Consider bundling both BETSE and BETSEE into a single Ubuntu snap,
#which has effectively emerged as the de facto cross-distro format for
#distributing POSIX-compatible applications, enabling a hypothetical "BETSEE"
#snap to be transparently executable under at least all Linux distributions
#satisfying all build time requirements for snap. Note, however, that:
#
#* The "snapd" daemon requires "systemd" as a mandatory dependency.
#  Fortunately, "systemd" is installable under Gentoo. (Yay!)
#* Neither the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) nor macOS does *NOT* currently
#  support "systemd" and hence does *NOT* support "snapd". Specifically:
#  * Although ongoing cooperation between Microsoft and Canonical strongly
#    suggests that the WSL will probably support "systemd" (and hence possibly
#    but *NOT* necessarily "snapd", which requires a host of Linux
#    kernel-specific containerization capabilities above and beyond those
#    required by merely "systemd") by no earlier than 2020.
#  * It's unclear whether either "systemd" or "snapd" will ever be installable
#    via Homebrew on macOS. Apple remains... uncooperative at best.
#
#The eventual hope, of course, is that the "snapd" daemon and corresponding
#"snapcraft" toolchain will be ported to both the Windows Subsystem for Linux
#(WSL) *AND* macOS, which would then effectively elevate Ubuntu snaps to the
#de facto cross-PLATFORM format for distributing POSIX-compatible applications.
#
#If nothing else, producing a "BETSEE" snap would at least have the
#demonstrable advantage of allowing Ubuntu users to install both BETSE and
#BETSEE with a single click from the official Ubuntu Store -- which is huge.
#Certainly, an Ubuntu snap appears to be dramatically more portable and hence
#superior to a traditional Ubuntu PPA for most purposes.

#FIXME: Replace this file (i.e., "setup.py") and the "requirements-pip.txt",
#"setup.cfg", "MANIFEST.in", and "Pipfile" files with the existing
#"pyproject.toml" file in concert with the third-party "poetry" project, which
#replaces Python's broken build management ecosystem (e.g., distutils,
#setuptools, pip, pipenv) with a single shell-friendly command patterned on
#industry-standard build management utilities published for other languages
#(e.g., Rust's "cargo"). We have manually inspected the "poetry" repository
#and, indeed, this is the setuptools killer we have long awaited.
#
#Note, however, that we may still require setuptools at runtime for dependency
#resolution -- which is quite alright, of course. Since everyone requires
#setuptools at installation-time, setuptools remains widely available and
#continuing to depend upon setuptools for a specific task remains sensible.
#FIXME: Actually, don't do this. The "poetry" installer is sadly insane,
#despite the sanity evidenced by the remainder of the "poetry" codebase. As is,
#"poetry" is largely unusable on platforms like Gentoo. Nonetheless, let's
#preserve this FIXME discussion for when "poetry" adopts a standard
#installation pathway.

#FIXME: Consider wrapping on Windows with "pynsist", a framework for generating
#Windows installers bundling Python applications complete with a Python
#interpreter and requisite packages.
#FIXME: Alternately, consider usage of Briefcase, which integrates cleanly with
#"poetry" and purports to centralize generation of platform-specific
#executables in a platform-agnostic way -- presumably by leveraging PyInstaller
#and similar lower-level frameworks under the hood. Sadly, Briefcase is
#extremely immature as of this writing (i.e., 2019 Q4) and inappropriate for
#production-ready applications.
#FIXME: Likewise, consider the PySide2- and PyQt5-specific "fman" build system
#integrating Qt, PySide2, PyInstaller, NSIS (under Windows), and ".deb" (under
#Ubuntu) for automated packaging of PySide2 applications. See also:
#    https://build-system.fman.io/
