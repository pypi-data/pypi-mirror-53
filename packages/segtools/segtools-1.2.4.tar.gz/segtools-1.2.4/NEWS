1.1.9:

  accurate computation of statistics (and not histogram approximation)

  options to segtools commands that plot using R.

  whole chromosome sequence

1.1.6:

* aggregation.R: fixed syntax error that caused segtools-aggregation to crash

1.1.5:

* common.R: print.image: create the filepath's parent directory, if it
  doesn't already exist
* fix bug related to: allow comment character of # in mnemonics files,
  and automatically add a comment to generated mnemonic files
* segtools-gmtk-parameters: fix bug related to: doesn't generate
  hierarchical mnemonics when Segway subseg is used but has
  cardinality 1

1.1.4:

* allow comment character of # in mnemonics files, and automatically
  add a comment to generated mnemonic files
* segtools-html-report: fix some problem with os.path.samefile()
  (maybe related to Python 2.7+)
* segtools-gmtk-parameters: doesn't generate hierarchical mnemonics
  when Segway subseg is used but has cardinality 1
* add requirement of numpy>=1.3 (because histogram semantics change in that version)

1.1.3:
* segtools-signal-distribution: added --order-tracks and --order-labels options
* install-script: now sets R_HOME enviroment variable which fixes some issues
* docs: fixed dead mnemonic file reference
* bugfix: removed 'new' argument to 'histrogram' for compatibility with
    newer versions of numpy
* bugfix: segtools-html-report no longer crashes when the mnemonic file is
    already in the place where it would be copied
* bugfix: fixed segtools-flatten unpacking error (when --filter option was
    not specified)

1.1.2:

* eliminated exclamation marks
* new autogen stuff from Sphinx to allow man page generation
* Bug fix: segtools-flatten now works when some files specify strand
  information and others don't.
* Install script: now searches for R a little harder, program versions are
  printed when found, and more errors are caught.
* segtools-flatten: added --filter option
* Docs: added workflow flowchart

1.1.1:
* Plotting: No longer plots to screen. This makes plotting cleaner, less
  error-prone, but slightly slower.
* Documentation: Updated to include command syntax

* Improved robustness of installation script
* Renamed many of the Segtools commands for simplicity

* Sped up aggregation

1.0.0:

* Added additional functionality to feature-distance
* Added flatten-bed module
