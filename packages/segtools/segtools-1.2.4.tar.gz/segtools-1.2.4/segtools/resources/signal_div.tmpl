  <ul>
    <li> The mean and standard deviation of the signal values for each
      track (row) within segments of each label (column). 
      The background color of each cell
      corresponds to the track-normalized mean signal value, mean_n. 
      The standard deviations are first adjusted according to the mean
      normalization to create a sd_n value for each track. 
      But, if max(sd_n) > 1 (at least one track has a standard deviation 
      greater than its mean), all sd_n are scaled by a constant K = max(sd_n). 
      Thus, 0 <= mean_n <= 1, and 0 <= sd_n/K <= 1.
      The horizontal bar inside each cell has a width proportional to the
      standard deviation (sd_n/K), and, if it is filled with colors,
      these colors correspond to mean_n +/- sd_n/K.
      Column-wise hierarchical
      clustering is used to group similar labels together, and
      mnemonics are assigned according to this label clustering.
