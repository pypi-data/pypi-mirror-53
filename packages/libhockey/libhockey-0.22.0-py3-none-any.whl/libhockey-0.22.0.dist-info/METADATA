`libhockey` is a wrapper around the Hockey App REST API. It's aim is to be a simple and easy to use as possible.

It doesn't cover every single API, but does the basics. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request for API support.

## Getting started

Just add the following and you are ready to go:

```python

import libhockey

client = libhockey.HockeyClient(access_token="...")
```

## Examples

#### Listing all versions of an app

```python
for version in client.versions.generate_all("[app id]"):
    print(version.download_url)
```

#### Uploading a build

```python
download_link = client.versions.upload("/path/to/app.ipa", "Release notes go here")
```

#### Find new crashes in a build

```python

current_crashes = client.crashes.groups_for_version("[app id]", "[current version id]")
previous_crashes = client.crashes.groups_for_version("[app id]", "[previous version id]")
new_crashes = list(set(current_crashes) - set(previous_crashes))

for crash in new_crashes:
    print(f"({crash.number_of_crashes}) {crash.crash_file} - {crash.crash_class}:{crash.crash_method}")
```
