**Python Native Automation Package Library**

The Tastiest Code You May Ever Consume 

## Overview
**pynapl** is the conglomeration of useful tactics that I have made work for my personal and professional automation. The hope is for **pynapl** to evolve and become something more (someday - Exeggutor!!!). 

Currently, **pynapl** will allow you to send emails. More will come!

#### Details
**pynapl.send_mail()**

This is a script to send out an HTML email.

#### NEVER TESTED ON REAL FRUIT
No warranties. No guarantees. But feel free to enjoy as you please. 

### License

**pynapl** is registered under the MIT license.

That means if you use it, mention me (keep the license in place) and we're cool.
