Description: This is CustomXepr's fork of PyQtGraph.
        
        This package installs into the cx_pyqtgraph namespace to avoid conflicts.
        
        PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4/PySide and
        numpy.
        
        It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
        Despite being written entirely in python, the library is very fast due to its
        heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching, Qt's GraphicsView framework for
        2D display, and OpenGL for 3D display.
