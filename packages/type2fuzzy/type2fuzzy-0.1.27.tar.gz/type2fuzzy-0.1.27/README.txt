Project Description

A type-2 fuzzy logic library providing:

1. Ways to define and work with general type-2 fuzzy sets
2. Ways to define and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets
3. Ways to generate z-sliced sets from general type-2 fuzzy sets
4. Functions to perform wavy-slice type-reduction (Mendel-John) on general type-2 fuzzy sets
5. Functions to perform interval type-2 reduction (Karnik-Mendel)
6. Functions to perform partial-centroid type-reduction on general type-2 fuzzy sets
7. Functions to perform defuzzification of type-1 fuzzy sets
7. Tools to measure the performance of algorithms
8. Tools to plot general, interval and z-sliced type-2 fuzzy sets and type-1 fuzzy sets.
and more
