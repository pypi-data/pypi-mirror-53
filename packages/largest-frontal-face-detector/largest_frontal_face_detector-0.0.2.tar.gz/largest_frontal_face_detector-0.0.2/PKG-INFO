Description: # Largest Face Detector
        
        The Largest Face Detector is a basic face detector that detects largest frontal face from image using external python dlib library (http://dlib.net/python/index.html).
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the Largest Face Detector from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/largest-frontal-face-detector/0.0.2/):
        
            pip install largest-frontal-face-detector
        
        The reader is supported on Python 3.6 and above.
        
        ## Pre-requisites
            1. numpy (pip install numpy)
            2. dlib (pip install dlib)
            3. PIL (pip install pillow)
        
        NOTE :: These dependency packages will be installed automatically upon installing largest-face-detector package.
        
        ## How to use
        
        The Largest Face Detector is a pip package, named `largest_face_detector`.  To detect face in a particular image, call the function `detect_largest_face` with image path as input (relative to current directory you are in)
        
            >>> import largest_face_detector
            >>> image = largest_face_detector.detect_largest_face('image.jpeg')
            $ Cropped face saved successfully at : /Users/kulshd/2019-10-05T14:08:20.086934_cropped_image.jpeg
        
        The function will return the cropped image as a 2D numpy array and also save it.
        
        Following are some requirements and assumptions for using this package -
        
            1. Image size must be within [1024,1024]. If it exceeds, NotImplementedError is raised.   
            2. If no face is detected by the package, a warning message is displayed
            3. Currently following image formats are supported - [.jpeg, .jpg, .png]
        
        You can also run test-cases to validate package functionality by downloading source .tar.gz file (https://pypi.org/project/largest-frontal-face-detector/0.0.1/#files),extracting and cd into folder largest_frontal_face_detector-0.0.2, and running `python3 -m unittest discover -v`
