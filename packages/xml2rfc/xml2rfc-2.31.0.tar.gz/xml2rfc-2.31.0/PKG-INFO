Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.31.0 (25 Sep 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release adds a feature to help with conditional line breaking
          inside table cells, and tweaks the layout of text in cells slightly.  It
          also fixes an incorrect line-break point and second-line indentation for
          long section titles in the v3 text formatter.  From the commit log:
        
          * Fixed an issue with leading and trailing space padding in table cells, 
            and refined it to consider the alignment setting.
        
          * Modified the text formatter to accept &zwsp; as a potential line-break 
            point.
        
          * Included zwsp in allowed special characters (in addition to nbsp, nbhy, 
            word-joiner and line-separator).
        
          * Fixed the line-breaking and second-line indentation of section titles 
            in v3 text output.
        
          * The start of an emacs nXML mode schema which explicitly mentions 
            xinclud in a couple of places.
        
          * Removed code left in pdf.py by mistake, and set options.pdf=True when 
            in the PdfWriter.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.30.0 (19 Sep 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added logging configuration for weasyprint.  This controls the logging
            level based on the --quiet and --verbose flags, and should make
            weasyprint logging ouput more consistent across systems.
        
          * Weasyprint reports ERROR if a CSS <link> URL isn't available, so we
            won't insert a <link> for "rfc-local.css" when generating PDF if the
            file doesn't exist.
        
          * Tweaked the Makefile to use --add-include in some cases, for regression 
            testing.
        
          * Corrected the <xi:include> links produced during v2v3 conversion with
            the --add-xinclude switch, 
        
          * Changed the code to not retain <!ENTITY> declarations after v2v3
            conversion.
        
          * Changed BaseV3Writer.die() to raise an exception, rather than exit on 
            the spot, in order to do the right thing when called as a library.
        
          * Tweaked the command-line messages when a fatal error is raised in a 
            writer.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.29.1 (18 Sep 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed an issue with pagination that could occur if a table (or other 
            block) longer than a page ended on the last page.
