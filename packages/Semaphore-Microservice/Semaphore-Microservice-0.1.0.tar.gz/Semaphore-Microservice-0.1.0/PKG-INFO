Description: # Semaphore Microservice
        
        This HTTP-based microservice offers a ReST API to acquire and release resources
        that are limited with a *semaphore* semantic.
        
        ## Use Cases
        ### Limited Number of Licenses in an Continuous Integration Environment
        
        Some software uses a global license server to checkout licenses while the software
        is executed. By default many license consumers (clients) fail and abort the
        execution if no valid license was found or if no license was free for a checkout.
        In such cases, a CI pipeline would also fail, because the job is failing caused by
        the license error. In many cases there are no retries nor waits for a license to
        become valid or available again. More over waiting time would be counted as job
        execution time.
        
        This semaphore service allow to acquire a license virtually before asking the actual
        license server. If no license is available, it will either wait or register a
        callback for the real working job.
