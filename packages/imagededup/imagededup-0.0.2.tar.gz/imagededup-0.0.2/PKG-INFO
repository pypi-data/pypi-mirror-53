Description: 
        imagededup is a python  package that provides functionality to find duplicates in a collection of images using a variety
        of algorithms. Additionally, an evaluation and experimentation framework, is also provided. Following details the
        functionality provided by the package:
        
        * Finding duplicates in a directory using one of the following algorithms:
            - Convolutional Neural Network
            - Perceptual hashing
            - Difference hashing
            - Wavelet hashing
            - Average hashing
        * Generation of features for images using one of the above stated algorithms.
        * Framework to evaluate effectiveness of deduplication given a ground truth mapping.
        * Plotting duplicates found for a given image file.
