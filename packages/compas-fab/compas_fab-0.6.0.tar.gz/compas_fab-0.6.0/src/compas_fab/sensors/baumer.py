class PosCon3D(SerialSensor):
    """Provides an interface for the `Baumer PosCon3D edge measurement sensor
    <http://www.baumer.com/us-en/products/distance-measurement/light-section-sensors/poscon-3d-edge-measurement/>`_.
    The sensor has different interfaces to retrieve its data. This
    class provides access to the serial interface (RS-485).

    This class is a context manager type, so it's best used in combination
    with the ``with`` statement to ensure resource deallocation.

    The protocol of the sensor when operated via RS-485 indicates that
    access to it must be locked programmatically before starting operations
    and unlocked on completion. This is handled automatically if you use
    this class on a ``with`` statement, otherwise, the methods ``begin()`` and
    ``end()`` must be invoked by hand.

    Args:
        serial (:obj:`serial.Serial`): Instance of the serial
            port used to communicate with the sensor.
        address (:obj:`int`): PosCon3D sensors have an address
            assigned, which defaults to 1. There's also a broadcast
            address (``PosCon3D.BROADCAST_ADDRESS``) that can be used
            to query the address of the sensor connected to the RS-485
            bus. Only one sensor can be in the bus when using the
            broadcast address to query for sensor's address.

    Examples:
        >>> from serial import Serial                                                   # doctest: +SKIP
