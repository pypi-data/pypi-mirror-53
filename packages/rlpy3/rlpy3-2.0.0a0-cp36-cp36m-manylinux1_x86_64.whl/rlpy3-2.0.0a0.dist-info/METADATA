Why Fork?
===============
This is my fork of RLPy.

RLPy is a good reinforcement learning library that has some great features
like custom representation classes and value function viewers.
However, it is no longer maintained and the PyPI version of RLPy is not
compatible with the latest numpy C-API, which causes runtime errors.

So I decided to fork the repository and provide a maintained version of
RLPy only for Python>=3.5, named RLPy3.
You can download wheels of RLPy3 from `PyPI`_.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/rlpy3

In addition, I pushed lots of refactorings, bug fixes, and new environments
such as `AnyRewardGridWorld`_.
To see what was changed, see the new `CHANGELOG`_.

.. _CHANGELOG: ./CHANGELOG.md
.. _AnyRewardGridWorld: ./rlpy/Domains/any_reward_grid_world.py

Screenshots
===============

   An agent that explores `GridWorld`_.

.. figure:: pictures/GridWorld4x5Value.png

   Value function of the agent.

.. _GridWorld: ./rlpy/Domains/GridWorld.py
