In order to provide some insight into the software development process of PROJECT-NAME community, several metrics on GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are presented below. In terms of GitHub terminology, these metrics are calculated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Review Efficiency Index (REI), measured as the number of closed pull requests out of the new ones in a given period.
	\item Time to Merge (TTM), measured as the time since a pull request is submitted until this is closed.
	\item Backlog Management Index (BMI), measured as the number of closed tickets out of open tickets in a given period.
	\item Time to Close issues (TTC), the time since an issue was opened till this is closed.
\end{itemize}


\begin{table}[H]

    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|l}%

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Closed out of opened pull requests(REI), closed out of opened issues (BMI), median time to merge pull requests (TTM) and median time to close issues(TTC)}
\end{table}
