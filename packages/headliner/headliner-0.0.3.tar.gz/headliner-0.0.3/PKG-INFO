Description: 
        Headliner is a library that was internally created to generate headlines from news articles. 
        In particular, we use sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) under the hood, 
        an encoder-decoder framework. We provide a very simple interface to train 
        and deploy seq2seq models. Although this library was created internally to 
        generate headlines, you can also use it for other tasks like machine translations,
        text summarization and many more.
