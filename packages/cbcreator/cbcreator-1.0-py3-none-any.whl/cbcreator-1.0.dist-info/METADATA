# cbcreator
YUSS class bands creator  
My middle school wants us to make a electronic class band
for our class about once a week, and I'm one of the maintainers of our class.
So I wondered, can I automate it?  
--so I started this  

Oh, and as well, this is my first Python project, so again, don't laugh at it.
