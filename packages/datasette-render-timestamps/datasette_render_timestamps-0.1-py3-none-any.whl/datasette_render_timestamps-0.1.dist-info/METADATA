Datasette plugin for rendering timestamps.

Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette to enable this new functionality:

    pip install datasette-render-timestamps

The plugin will then look out for integer numbers that are likely to be timestamps (defaults to anything that would be a number of seconds from 5 years ago to 5 years in the future - this will be configurable eventually).

These will then be rendered in a more readable format.
