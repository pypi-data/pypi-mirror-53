Description: # mkdocs-versioning
        
        mkdocs-versioning is a plugin for [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a
        tool designed to create static websites usually for generating project
        documentation. mkdocs-versioning extends mkdocs by differentiating
        between different versions of documentation you may build. For example,
        a newer versions of some software may work differently from an older
        version and it is important that users of an older version of the
        software reads the appropriate version of the documentation in order to
        ensure that the user has the correct information and uses the software
        appropriately.
