Migrating from .system files
----------------------------

Why
~~~

The synthesis backends required a separate .system file in addition to the .core file. There is however very little information in the .system file, it was never properly documented and some information is duplicated from the .core file. For these reasons a decision was made to drop the .system file and move the relevant information to the .core file instead.

When
~~~~
`.system` files are no longer needed as of FuseSoC 1.6

The `.system` file will still be supported for some time to allow users to perform the migration, but any equivalent options in the `.core` file will override the ones in `.system`

How
~~~

Perform the following steps to migrate from .system files

1. Move the `backend` parameter from the `main` section in the `.system` file to the `main` section in the `.core` file

2. Move the backend section (i.e. `icestorm`, `ise`, `quartus` or `vivado`) to the `.core` file

3. Move `pre_build_scripts` from the `scripts` section in the `.system` file to `pre_synth_scripts` in the `scripts` section in the `.core` file.

4. Move `post_build_scripts` from the `scripts` section in the `.system` file to `post_impl_scripts` in the `scripts` section in the `.core` file.

Migrating from plusargs
-----------------------

Why
~~~
Up until FuseSoC 1.3, verilog plusargs were the only way to set external run-time parameters. Cores could register which plusargs they supported through the `plusargs` section. This mechanism turned out to be too limited, and in order to support public/private parameters, defines, VHDL generics etc, `parameter` sections were introduced to replace the `plusargs` section.

When
~~~~

`parameter` sections were introduced in FuseSoC 1.3

The `plusargs` section is still supported to allow time for migrations

How
~~~

Entries in the `plusargs` section are described as `<name> = <type> <description>`. For each of these entries, create a new section with the following contents

    [parameter <name>]
    datatype = <type>
    description = <description>
    paramtype = plusarg

The `parameter` sections also support the additional tags `default`, to set a default value, and `scope` to select if this parameter should be visible to other cores (`scope=public`) or only when this core is used as the toplevel (`scope=private`).

Migrating to filesets
---------------------

Why
~~~
Originally only verilog source files were supported. In order to make source code handling more generic, filesets were introduced. Filesets are modeled after IP-XACT filesets and each fileset lists a group of files with similar purpose. Apart from supporting more file types, the filesets contain some additional control over when to use the files. The verilog section is still supported for some time to allow users to perform the migration.

When
~~~~
`fileset` sections were introduced in FuseSoC 1.4

The `verilog` section is still supported to allow time for migrations

How
~~~

Given a `verilog` section with the following contents:

    [verilog]
    src_files = file1.v file2.v
    include_files = file3.vh file4.vh
    tb_src_files = file5.v file6.v
    tb_include_files = file7.vh file8.vh
    tb_private_src_files = file9.v file10.v

these will be turned into multiple file sets. The names of the file sets are not important, but should reflect the usage of the files.

    [fileset src_files]
    files = file1.v file2.v
    file_type = verilogSource

    [fileset include_files]
    files = file3.vh file4.vh
    file_type = verilogSource
    is_include_file = true

    [fileset tb_src_files]
    files = file5.v file6.v
    file_type = verilogSource
    usage = sim

    [fileset tb_include_files]
    files = file7.vh file8.vh
    file_type = verilogSource
    is_include_file = true
    usage = sim

    [fileset tb_private_src_files]
    files = file9.v file10.v
    file_type = verilogSource
    scope = private
    usage = sim

If not specified, `usage = sim synth` and `scope = public`

These filesets can be further combined by setting some per-file attributes

    [fileset src_files]
    files =
     file1.v
     file2.v
     file3.vh[is_include_file]
     file4.vh[is_include_file]
    file_type = verilogSource

    [fileset public_tb_files]
    files = file5.v file6.v file7.vh[is_include_file] file8.vh[is_include_file]
    file_type = verilogSource
    usage = sim

    [fileset tb_files]
    files = file9.v file10.v
    file_type = verilogSource
    scope = private
    usage = sim

`file_type` can also be overridden on a per-file basis (e.g. `file2.v[file_type=verilogSource-2005]` `file3.vh[is_include_file,file_type=systemVerilogSource]`), but scope and usage are set for each fileset.

Migrating from verilator define_files
-------------------------------------

Why
~~~
Files specified as `define_files` in the verilator core section were treated as verilog files containing ` `define` statements to C header files with equivalent #define statements. While there are use-cases for this functionality, the actual implementation is limited and makes assumptions that makes it difficult to maintain in the FuseSoC code base. The decision is therefore made to deprecate this functionality and instead require the user to make the conversion.

When
~~~~
`verilator define_files` are no longer converted in FuseSoC 1.7

How
~~~

The following stand-alone Python script will perform the same function. It can also be executed as a `pre_build` script to perform the conversion automatically before a build

    def convert_V2H( read_file, write_file):
        fV = open (read_file,'r')
        fC = open (write_file,'w')
        fC.write("//File auto-converted the Verilog to C. converted by FuseSoC//\n")
        fC.write("//source file --> " + read_file + "\n")
        for line in fV:
            Sline=line.split('`',1)
            if len(Sline) == 1:
                fC.write(Sline[0])
            else:
                fC.write(Sline[0]+"#"+Sline[1])
        fC.close
        fV.close
    
    import sys
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        convert_V2H(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

Migrating to core libraries
---------------------------

Why
~~~

FuseSoC already has the ability to define directory paths which contain core files, either by specifying them with the cores_root option in fusesoc.conf, on the command-line with `--cores-root=` or through the `FUSESOC_CORES` environment variable. If no cores root was specified with any of the aforemented methods, FuseSoC whill also look for a directory named `cores` in the current working directory and add that if it exists. There is also an even older `systems_root` option in fusesoc.conf that has been deprecated since FuseSoC 1.2 since it serves no purpose over cores_root. Just having a list of paths has turned out to have limitations and makes some library management features hard to implement. With FuseSoC 1.8 comes support for core libraries where each library is specified in fusesoc.conf as a separate section. The library feature obsoletes the list of core directories

When
~~~~

Core libraries were introduced in FuseSoC 1.8.

Support for the `cores_root` and `systems_root` options in fusesoc.conf, the command-line switch `--cores-root=` and the `FUSESOC_CORES` environment variable will remain for some time to allow for migrations.

How
~~~

Each entry in the `cores_root` option in fusesoc.conf will have to be migrated to their own library section. A fusesoc.conf looking like this

    [main]
    cores_root = /home/user/.local/share/fusesoc/orpsoc-cores /home/user/cores/fusesoc-cores

will now look like this


    [library.orpsoc-cores]
    
    [library.fusesoc-cores]
    location = /home/user/cores/fusesoc-cores

One thing to notice is that if the location option is missing, it will default to $XDG_DATA_HOME/fusesoc/<library name>
