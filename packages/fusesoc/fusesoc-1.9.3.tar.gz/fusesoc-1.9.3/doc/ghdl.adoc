GHDL
====

GHDL is an open source VHDL simulator, which fully supports IEEE 1076-1987, IEEE 1076-1993, IEE 1076-2002 and partially the 1076-2008 version of VHDL

Configure
---------
During the configure phase, a Makefile will be created with rules for building
and running the simulation model

Build
-----

Run `make` to (re)build the simulation model

Run
---
`make run` will launch in batch mode to run the simulation and exit afterwards

Additional arguments can be set with the `EXTRA_OPTIONS` environment variable, e.g.
`make run EXTRA_OPTIONS="-goption1=value1 -goption2=value2"`
