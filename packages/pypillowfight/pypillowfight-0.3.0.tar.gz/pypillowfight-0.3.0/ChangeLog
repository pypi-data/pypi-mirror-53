2019/10/09 -- 0.3.0:
- Add algorithm 'scan_borders': On a scanned image, this algorithm tries to
  figure out where are the page borders. This algorithm is meant to be an
  helper for scan cropping (it doesn't work with all scanners).
- Sobel: remove trailing lines at the left and the top of resulting intensity
  matrix (and resulting image)
- SWT: Fix memory leak
- CMakeLists.txt: add SOVERSION
- CMakeLists.txt: Use CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR instead of LIBDIR

2018/04/10 -- 0.2.4:
- Fix build on ARM CPUs

2018/03/01 -- 0.2.3:
- setup.py: Enable explicitely the use of SSE2 instructions on i386 arch.
  It makes the test results consistent with amd64 architecture.
- Do not use values.h (obsolete ; unavailable on MacOSX and some Windows
  installations)
- CMakeLists: allow custom libraries directory (/usr/lib64 for instance)
- compare: fix the expected size for the output image when comparing 2 images
  with different sizes (fix sigabort on assert())

2017/06/06 -- 0.2.2:
- compare: allow image of different sizes as input

2016/10/05 -- 0.2.1:
- Add algorithm 'compare' (basic image difference visualisation)
- ACE: Fix alpha channel
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 support

2016/09/08 -- 0.2.0:
- SWT: Make it possible to specify the type of output wanted
- Windows portage
- Python: Allows other threads to run while one of the function is running
