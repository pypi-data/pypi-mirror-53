    "## Using Notebooks with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is extremely useful for managing source code and it can and should also be used for managing Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "There is one caveat, however:\n",
    "Notebooks can contain output cells with rich media like images, plots, sounds, HTML, JavaScript and many other types of bulky machine-created content.\n",
    "This can make it hard to work with Git efficiently, because changes in those bulky contents can completely obscure the more interesting human-made changes in text and source code.\n",
    "Working with multiple collaborators on a notebook can become very tedious because of this.\n",

    "It is therefore highly recommended that you remove all outputs from your notebooks before committing changes to a Git repository (except for the reasons mentioned in [Pre-Executing Notebooks](pre-executed.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no output cells in a notebook, `nbsphinx` will by default execute the notebook, and the pages generated by Sphinx will therefore contain all the output cells.\n",
    "See [Controlling Notebook Execution](executing-notebooks.ipynb) for how this behavior can be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter Notebook application, you can manually clear all outputs by selecting\n",
    "\"Cell\" $\\to$ \"All Output\" $\\to$ \"Clear\" from the menu.\n",
    "In JupyterLab, the menu items are \"Edit\" $\\to$ \"Clear All Outputs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tools available to remove outputs from multiple files at once without having to open them separately.\n",
    "You can even include such a tool as \"clean/smudge filters\" into your Git workflow, which will strip the output cells automatically whenever a Git command is executed.\n",
