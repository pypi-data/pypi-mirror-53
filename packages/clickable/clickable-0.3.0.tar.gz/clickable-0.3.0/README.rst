Clickable is based on the following building-blocks:

* a bootstrap.py standalone script that installs a conda based python environment,
  that allows to initialize an isolated python environment.
  (https://github.com/lalmeras/clickable_bootstrap)

* a bootstrap.py's post-install callback that uses poetry to install:

  * your project-related command(s)
  * by python dependencies mechanism, clickable and any optional dependencies

* clickable python library, that provides a clickables.py/clickables.yml file
  loading mechanism
