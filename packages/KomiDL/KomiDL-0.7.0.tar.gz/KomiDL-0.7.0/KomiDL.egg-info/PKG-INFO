        ===========
        
        KomiDL (繧ｳ繝櫂L) is a command-line program that can download images and series
        from web galleries.
        
        Inspired by youtube-dl, KomiDL is able to download
        images from any supported website URL. It also supports tag extraction and
        can export files downloaded to formats such as archives (zip, tar, gztar,
        bztar) or PDF.
        
        Custom extractors can be written by implementing the abstract Extractor class
        and registering it to extractors.py.
        
        As the program is currently in early stages of development, bugs are likely
        to occur. Use the program at your own risk.
