        Sawx -- Simple Application-framework for wxPython

        Abstract
        ========
        
        This is a simple application framework system for wxPython, providing a multi-
        tabbed, multi-frame environment with simple-to-understand support for dynamic
        menubars, toolbars, and popup menus. Also includes many small utilities and
        convenience classes, such as a tile layout control that can replace more complicated controls like the wx.aui.AuiManager.
        
        
        Images
        ======
        
        Professionally design icons supplied by `icons8 <https://icons8.com>`_ which
        provides established open-source projects with a free license.
        
        I did need some icons that were too esoteric/project-specific for a design
        house, so there are several I created myself. You'll note those in the source
        because they don't start with ``icons8-`` in the ``sawx/icons`` directory.
