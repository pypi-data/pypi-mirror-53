- [ ] Restructure code-base to be broken up into the different parts
      of the wrapping process and unclutter \_\_init__.py in the process.
      (i.e. parse_fortran.py, generate_fortran_wrapper.py,
       generate_cython_wrapper.py, construct_py_module.py)

- [ ] Add example fortran programs that can be used as test cases and
      demonstrations for new users.
