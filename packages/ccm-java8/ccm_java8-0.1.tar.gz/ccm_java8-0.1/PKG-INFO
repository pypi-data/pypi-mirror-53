Description: # ccm-java8
        
        _ccm-java8_ is a simple [CCM](https://github.com/riptano/ccm/) extension that explicitly sets the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for all CCM-managed
        Cassandra nodes to an available Java 1.8 installation, which is required to run Cassandra 3.11 and lower.
        
        While operating systems support the side-by-side installation of multiple Java versions, only one version can be selected as the default
        (i.e., what version `java` on `$PATH` points to).
        Cassandra's `bin/cassandra` launch script prefers the `java` binary under `$JAVA_HOME`, and will fallback to using the `java` binary on `$PATH` if `$JAVA_HOME` isn't set.
        Hence, unless `$JAVA_HOME` or the default is explicitly set to a Java 1.8 installation, Cassandra will try, and fail, to start under an incompatible Java version.
        
        _ccm-java8_ works by registering a CCM extension, and hooks into the `append_to_server_env` method that allows extensions to provide additional environment variables
        for each Cassandra process started by CCM.
        On node start, _ccm-java8_ explicitly sets the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to a directory containing a Java 1.8 installation, or throws an exception otherwise.
