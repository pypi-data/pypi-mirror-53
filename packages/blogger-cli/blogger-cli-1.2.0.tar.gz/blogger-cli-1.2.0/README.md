## üíª Installation

### Recommended Method
```
$ curl -sSL https://hemanta212.github.io/blogger-cli/get_blogger.py | python
```
Since blogger has alot of dependecies (nbconvert, jupyter), this custom installer will install them in a virtual environment and add it to your path for global access.

### Using pip
```
pip install blogger-cli
```

If you mainly use jupyter notebooks, then you already have all the required dependencies although it is recommended to use `virutal environments`.


## üöÄ Getting Started
