**imageproxy** is a small standalone WSGI application that dynamically
resizes images.

It supports virtual hosting, so you can use the same instance to serve
assets for different domains.

Example config file::

    [site:example.net]
    root=/srv/example.net/web/media/images
    prefix=/assets/media/images

    [site:example.com]
    root=/srv/example.com/web/media/images
    prefix=/assets/media/images

By default only JPEG files can be resized, but if you'd like to make
GIFs and PNGs resizable, add the following::

    [type:image/gif]
    resize=true

    [type:image/png]
    resize=true

You can specify the configuration file location by giving its path in
the ``IMAGEPROXY_SETTINGS`` environment variable.

If you want to use this with Paste, it comes with a sample config file.
Naturally, you'll need Paste, PasteDeploy, and PasteScript to run it.
However, Paste isn't required and the ``imageproxy.create_application``
callable can be used with any WSGI server.
