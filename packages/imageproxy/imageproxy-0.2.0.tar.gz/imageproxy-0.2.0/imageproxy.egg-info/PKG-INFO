Description: **imageproxy** is a small standalone WSGI application that dynamically
        resizes images.
        
        It supports virtual hosting, so you can use the same instance to serve
        assets for different domains.
        
        Example config file::
        
            [site:example.net]
            root=/srv/example.net/web/media/images
            prefix=/assets/media/images
        
            [site:example.com]
            root=/srv/example.com/web/media/images
            prefix=/assets/media/images
        
        By default only JPEG files can be resized, but if you'd like to make
        GIFs and PNGs resizable, add the following::
        
            [type:image/gif]
            resize=true
        
            [type:image/png]
            resize=true
        
        You can specify the configuration file location by giving its path in
        the ``IMAGEPROXY_SETTINGS`` environment variable.
        
        If you want to use this with Paste, it comes with a sample config file.
        Naturally, you'll need Paste, PasteDeploy, and PasteScript to run it.
        However, Paste isn't required and the ``imageproxy.create_application``
        callable can be used with any WSGI server.
