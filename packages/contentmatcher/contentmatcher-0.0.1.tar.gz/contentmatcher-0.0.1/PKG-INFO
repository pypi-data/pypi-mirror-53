Description: # contentmatcher  
        A pattern-based content matcher for Python programs  
          
        ##### Current state: Under development (alpha)  
          
          
        It provides:  
          * Match ratios based on amount of pattern that was matched  
          * Fast method for first-pass match
            * Allows filtering out patterns that are unlikely to match  
            * More thorough matching can be performed with patterns that are more likely to match, reducing time requirements  
          
        Original use case:  
          * matching a list of function names from a backtrace to known patterns  
          
        Installation:  
          * pip install contentmatcher  
          
        Tested for Python >=3.6.5 on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows 7/10
