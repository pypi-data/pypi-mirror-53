Overview
--------

``truthdiscovery`` is a Python3 library that implements various truth discovery
algorithms.

A truth discovery problem consists of

- a number of *sources*
- a number of *objects*
- for each source, a set of *claims* made by the source, with each claim
  relating to a distinct object

An object may be associated with multiple (conflicting) claims from different
sources, in which case it is not clear up front which is the true claim. It is
typically assumed that there is only one true claim for each object.

Truth discovery addresses this by using the network of sources, claims and
objects to determine the *trustworthiness* of sources, the *belief* in each
claim, and the true claim for each object.

The general principle for most algorithms is that trustworthy sources make
believably claims, and believable claims are made my trustworthy sources.

Most approaches are *unsupervised*, in that they do not use any prior knowledge
for the trustworthiness of sources etc.

The library can be used via its Python API, command-line client, or web
interface.

Installation
------------

This package can be installed from PyPi with ``pip`` (using Python 3). It is
recommended to work in a `virtualenv
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ to avoid conflicts with
globally-installed packages::

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install truthdiscovery

Usage
-----
Python API: ::

    >>> from truthdiscovery import Dataset, TruthFinder
    >>> mydata = Dataset([
    ...     ("source 1", "x", 4),
    ...     ("source 1", "y", 7),
    ...     ("source 2", "y", 7),
    ...     ("source 2", "z", 5),
    ...     ("source 3", "x", 3),
    ...     ("source 3", "z", 5),
    ...     ("source 4", "x", 3),
    ...     ("source 4", "y", 6),
    ...     ("source 4", "z", 8)
    ... ])
    >>> alg = TruthFinder()
    >>> results = alg.run(mydata)
    >>> # What is most likely value for x?
    ... set(results.get_most_believed_values("x"))
    {3}
    >>> # How trustworthy are the sources?
    ... results.trust
    {'source 1': 0.6519911420410474, 'source 2': 0.715051359018607, 'source 3':
    0.7125585145162463, 'source 4': 0.6283823616003958}

See :ref:`input-page` for how to construct different types of datasets,
:ref:`algorithms-page` to see which algorithms are available and the parameters
they can accept, and :ref:`output-page` for how to use the results returned
from an algorithm.

Command-line client (for datasets in :ref:`csv-format`): ::

    truthdiscovery run --algorithm sums --dataset mydata.csv

    # Can run multiple algorithms at once
    truthdiscovery run --algorithm sums investment --dataset mydata.csv

    # Change the default parameters
    truthdiscovery run --algorithm sums average_log \
        --dataset mydata.csv --params priors=uniform

    # Can give multiple parameters
    truthdiscovery run --algorithm investment --dataset mydata.csv \
        --params g=1.15 priors=fixed

    # Can use fixed or till-convergence iteration
    truthdiscovery run --algorithm truthfinder --dataset mydata.csv \
        --params iterator=fixed-200

    truthdiscovery run --algorithm truthfinder --dataset mydata.csv \
        --params iterator=l1-convergence-0.01

    truthdiscovery run --algorithm truthfinder --dataset mydata.csv \
        --params iterator=l_inf-convergence-0.01-limit-200

    # Restrict results to a subset of sources/variables
    truthdiscovery run --algorithm sums --dataset mydata.csv \
        --sources 0 3 --variables 1 2

    # Fields to show in the output can be selected with --output
    truthdiscovery run --algorithm sums --dataset mydata.csv \
        --output time iterations belief most_believed_values

    # Synthetic data generation
    truthdiscovery synth --trust 0.5 0.6 0.7 --num-vars 5 \
        --domain-size 10 --claim-prob 0.8

    # --supervised treats the first row of the dataset as known
    # true values, and allows accuracy to be calculated
    truthdiscovery run -a sums -f mydata.csv --supervised -o accuracy

See ``truthdiscovery --help`` and ``truthdiscovery <COMMAND> --help`` for
detailed usage and all the available options.

The web interface can be started on ``localhost:5000`` with ``truthdiscovery
httpd`` (note that this uses the debug Flask server, so should not be used in a
production environment).
