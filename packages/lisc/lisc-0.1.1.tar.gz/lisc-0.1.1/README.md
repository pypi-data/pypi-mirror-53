LISC is a package for collecting and analyzing the scientific literature.

## Overview

LISC acts as a wrapper and connector between available APIs, allowing users to collect data from and about scientific articles, and to do analyses on this data, such as performing automated meta-analyses.

A curated list of some projects enabled by LISC is available on the [projects](https://github.com/lisc-tools/Projects) page.

#### Supported APIs

Supported APIs through LISC includes:
- the NCBI [EUtils](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/). EUtils provides programmatic access to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), including the Pubmed database.
- the [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net) API. OpenCitations provides access to citation data.

#### Data Collection

For data collection, LISC currently offers support for the following 'types' of literature data collection:
- 'Counts': collects counts and co-occurrences of specified search terms in the literature.
- 'Words': collects text data and meta-data from articles identified by specified search terms.
- 'Citations': collect citation and reference data for articles, based on DOIs.

#### Analysis & Other Functionality

In addition to connecting to external APIs, LISC also provides:
- custom data objects for managing collected data
- a database structure, and save and load utilties for storing collected data
- functions and utilities to analyze collected data
- Data visualization functions for plotting collected data and analysis outputs
