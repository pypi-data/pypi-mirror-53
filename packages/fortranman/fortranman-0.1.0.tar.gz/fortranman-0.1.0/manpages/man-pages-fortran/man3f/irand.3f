.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIIRAND(FLAG)\fP returns a pseudo-random number from a uniform
distribution between 0 and a system-dependent limit (which is in most
cases 2147483647). If \fIFLAG\fP is 0, the next number
in the current sequence is returned; if \fIFLAG\fP is 1, the generator
is restarted by \fICALL SRAND(0)\fP; if \fIFLAG\fP has any other value,
it is used as a new seed with \fISRAND\fP.

.PP
This intrinsic routine is provided for backwards compatibility with
GNU Fortran 77. It implements a simple modulo generator as provided
by \fIg77\fP. For new code, one should consider the use of
RANDOM_NUMBER as it implements a superior algorithm.

.SH STANDARD
GNU extension

.SH CLASS
Function

.SH SYNTAX
\fIRESULT = IRAND(I)\fP

.SH ARGUMENTS

.PP
\fII\fP Shall be a scalar \fIINTEGER\fP of kind 4.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is of \fIINTEGER(kind=4)\fP type.

.SH EXAMPLE

          program test_irand
            integer,parameter :: seed = 86456
          
            call srand(seed)
            print *, irand(), irand(), irand(), irand()
            print *, irand(seed), irand(), irand(), irand()
          end program test_irand
