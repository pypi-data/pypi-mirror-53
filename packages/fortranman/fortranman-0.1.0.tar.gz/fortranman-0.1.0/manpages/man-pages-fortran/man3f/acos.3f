.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIACOS(X)\fP computes the arccosine of \fIX\fP (inverse of \fICOS(X)\fP).

.SH STANDARD
Fortran 77 and later, for a complex argument Fortran 2008 or later

.SH CLASS
Elemental function

.SH SYNTAX
\fIRESULT = ACOS(X)\fP

.SH ARGUMENTS

.PP
\fIX\fP The type shall either be \fIREAL\fP with a magnitude that is
less than or equal to one - or the type shall be \fICOMPLEX\fP.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is of the same type and kind as \fIX\fP. 
The real part of the result is in radians and lies in the range
0 <=q Re acos(x) <=q PI.

.SH EXAMPLE

          program test_acos
            real(8) :: x = 0.866_8
            x = acos(x)
          end program test_acos
