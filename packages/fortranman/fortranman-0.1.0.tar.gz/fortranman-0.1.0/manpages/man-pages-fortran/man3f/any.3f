.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIANY(MASK [, DIM])\fP determines if any of the values in the logical array
\fIMASK\fP along dimension \fIDIM\fP are \fI.TRUE.\fP.

.SH STANDARD
Fortran 95 and later

.SH CLASS
Transformational function

.SH SYNTAX
\fIRESULT = ANY(MASK [, DIM])\fP

.SH ARGUMENTS

.PP
\fIMASK\fP The type of the argument shall be \fILOGICAL\fP and
it shall not be scalar. 
\fIDIM\fP  (Optional) \fIDIM\fP shall be a scalar integer
with a value that lies between one and the rank of \fIMASK\fP.

.SH RETURN VALUE
\fIANY(MASK)\fP returns a scalar value of type \fILOGICAL\fP where
the kind type parameter is the same as the kind type parameter of
\fIMASK\fP.  If \fIDIM\fP is present, then \fIANY(MASK, DIM)\fP returns
an array with the rank of \fIMASK\fP minus 1.  The shape is determined from
the shape of \fIMASK\fP where the \fIDIM\fP dimension is elided.

          

\fB(A)\fP \fIANY(MASK)\fP is true if any element of \fIMASK\fP is true;
otherwise, it is false.  It also is false if \fIMASK\fP has zero size. 

\fB(B)\fP If the rank of \fIMASK\fP is one, then \fIANY(MASK,DIM)\fP is equivalent
to \fIANY(MASK)\fP.  If the rank is greater than one, then \fIANY(MASK,DIM)\fP
is determined by applying \fIANY\fP to the array sections. 


.SH EXAMPLE

          program test_any
            logical l
            l = any((/.true., .true., .true./))
            print *, l
            call section
            contains
              subroutine section
                integer a(2,3), b(2,3)
                a = 1
                b = 1
                b(2,2) = 2
                print *, any(a .eq. b, 1)
                print *, any(a .eq. b, 2)
              end subroutine section
          end program test_any
