.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIATOMIC_FETCH_ADD(ATOM, VALUE, OLD)\fP atomically stores the value of
\fIATOM\fP in \fIOLD\fP and adds the value of \fIVAR\fP to the
variable \fIATOM\fP. When \fISTAT\fP is present and the invokation was
successful, it is assigned the value 0. If it is present and the invokation
has failed, it is assigned a positive value; in particular, for a coindexed
\fIATOM\fP, if the remote image has stopped, it is assigned the value of
\fIISO_FORTRAN_ENV\fP's \fISTAT_STOPPED_IMAGE\fP and if the remote image has
failed, the value \fISTAT_FAILED_IMAGE\fP.

.SH STANDARD
TS 18508 or later

.SH CLASS
Atomic subroutine

.SH SYNTAX
\fICALL ATOMIC_FETCH_ADD (ATOM, VALUE, old [, STAT])\fP

.SH ARGUMENTS

.PP
\fIATOM\fP   Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of integer
type with \fIATOMIC_INT_KIND\fP kind. 
\fIATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND\fP kind.

.PP
\fIVALUE\fP  Scalar of the same type as \fIATOM\fP. If the kind
is different, the value is converted to the kind of \fIATOM\fP. 
\fIOLD\fP    Scalar of the same type and kind as \fIATOM\fP. 
\fISTAT\fP   (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

.SH EXAMPLE

          program atomic
            use iso_fortran_env
            integer(atomic_int_kind) :: atom[*], old
            call atomic_add (atom[1], this_image(), old)
          end program atomic
