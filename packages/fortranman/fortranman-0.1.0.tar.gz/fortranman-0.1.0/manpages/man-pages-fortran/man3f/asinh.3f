.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIASINH(X)\fP computes the inverse hyperbolic sine of \fIX\fP.

.SH STANDARD
Fortran 2008 and later

.SH CLASS
Elemental function

.SH SYNTAX
\fIRESULT = ASINH(X)\fP

.SH ARGUMENTS

.PP
\fIX\fP The type shall be \fIREAL\fP or \fICOMPLEX\fP.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is of the same type and kind as  \fIX\fP. If \fIX\fP is
complex, the imaginary part of the result is in radians and lies between
-PI/2 <=q Im asinh(x) <=q PI/2.

.SH EXAMPLE

          PROGRAM test_asinh
            REAL(8), DIMENSION(3) :: x = (/ -1.0, 0.0, 1.0 /)
            WRITE (*,*) ASINH(x)
          END PROGRAM
.SH SPECIFIC NAMES
