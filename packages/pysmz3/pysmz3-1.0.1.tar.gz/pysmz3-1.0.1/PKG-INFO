Description: # pysmz3 for Python 3.6/3.7!
        Pyz3r is an unofficial python abstraction library for interacting with the [samus.link](https://samus.link) API.
        
        This allows developers to create applications that not only generate games on [samus.link](https://samus.link),
        but also create the ROM as well using the patch data provided by the website.
        
        It is a very stripped down version of pyz3r.  All game patching code was removed, and most other code was removed too.
        
        ## Installation
        This module is available on PyPI.  It can be installed via pip:
        
        `pip install pysmz3`
        
        ## Compatiblity
        This library has been tested on both Linux (Centos 7) and Windows on Python 3.6 and 3.7.
