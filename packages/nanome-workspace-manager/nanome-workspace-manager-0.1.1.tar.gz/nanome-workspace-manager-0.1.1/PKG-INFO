Description: # Nanome - Workspace Manager
        
        ### A plugin allowing standalone VR headset users to save and load workspaces
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install nanome-workspace-manager
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        #### To start the plugin:
        
        ```sh
        $ nanome-workspace-manager -a plugin_server_address
        ```
        
        ---
        
        #### In Nanome:
        
        - Activate Plugin
        - Login with account (default is admin/admin)
        - Name your workspace, then click on "Save" to save your workspace
        - Click on a workspace to load it
        - Click on delete next to a workspace to remove it from the plugin's storage
        
        --- 
        
        #### Managing Accounts:
        
        Accounts for the workspace manager plugin are stored in `~/Documents/nanome-workspace-manager/accounts.txt`.
        
        Each line contains `<username> <password> <is_admin>` where the password is hashed.
        
        `is_admin` can either be `0` or `1` where `1` will allow the user to view and delete anyone's workspace. 
        
        To add an account, add a line to the file with the plaintext `username`, `password`, and `is_admin`. The next time the plugin is run, all plaintext passwords will automatically be hashed.
        
        To change the password of an account, simply change the second value on a line to the desired password.
        
        | NOTE: make sure to replace the admin account or change its password! |
        | - |
        
        If you do not wish to use accounts, you can start the plugin with the `-d` or `--disable-accounts` flag. Note that when accounts are disabled, everyone connected to the plugin can see or delete everyone else's saved workspaces.
