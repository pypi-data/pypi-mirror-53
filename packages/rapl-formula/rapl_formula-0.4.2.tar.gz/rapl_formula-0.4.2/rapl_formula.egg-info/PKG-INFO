Description: # RAPL-formula
        
        A [powerAPI](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/powerapi) formula using RAPL
        counters to provides power consumption information of each socket of the
        monitored machine.
        
        Use RAPL data collected with the
        [hwpc-sensor](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/hwpc-sensor) and convert it into
        power consumption measures (in Watt). The power consumption measures are store
        in a MongoDB database.
        
        # Quick start
        
        We detail here how to quickly start rapl-formula and connect it to a hwpc-sensor
        using a mongoDB instance.
        
        For more detail see our documentation [here](http://powerapi.org)
        
        ## Get input data
        
        You have to launch the [hwpc-sensor](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/hwpc-sensor) to 
        monitor sockets. The sensor must store its data in a mongoDB database. This
        database must be accessible by the rapl_formula.
        
        ## Launch formula
        
        with python(>=3.7):
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m rapl_formula --output mongodb --uri input_mongo_uri --db input_db
        	--collection input_collection --input mongodb --uri output_mongo_uri --db output_db
        	--collection output_collection
        ```
        
        with docker:
        
        ```bash
        docker run powerapi/rapl-formula --output mongodb --uri input_mongo_uri --db input_db
        	--collection input_collection --input mongodb --uri output_mongo_uri --db output_db
        	--collection output_collection
        ```
        
        with the following configuration: 
        
        - input_mongo_uri : uri to the mongoDB used by the hwpc-sensor to store its output data
        - input_db : database used by the hwpc-sensor to store its output data
        - input_collection : collection used by the hwpc-sensor to store its output data
        - output_mongo_uri : uri to the mongoDB used to store the power consumption data
        - output_db : database used to store the power consumption data
        - output_collection : collection used to store the power consumption data
