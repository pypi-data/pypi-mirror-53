        ================
        
        This is a native Linux GUI for casting local files to Chromecast
        devices. It supports:
        
        -  Both audio and video files (anything ``ffmpeg`` can read)
        -  Realtime transcoding (only when needed)
        -  Subtitles (embedded and external SRT files)
        -  Fast scrubbing (waiting 20s for buffering to skip 30s ahead is
           wrong!)
        -  4K videos on the Chromecast Ultra!
        
        What’s New
        ----------
        
        -  ``1.9``: Multi video/audio stream support.
        -  ``1.8``: 5.1/7.1 surround sound E/AC3 support.
        -  ``1.7``: Drag and drop files into the main UI.
        -  ``1.6``: Mutiple file / queuing support.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Please run:
        
        ::
        
           $ sudo apt install ffmpeg python3-pip python3-gi
           $ pip3 install gnomecast
        
        If installing in a ``mkvirtualenv`` built virtual environment, make sure
        you include the ``--system-site-packages`` parameter to get the GTK
        bindings.
        
        Run
        ---
        
        After installing, log out and log back in. It will be in your launcher:

           alt text
        
        You can also run it from the command line:
        
        ::
        
           $ gnomecast
        
        Or:
        
        ::
        
           $ python3 -m gnomecast
        
        *Please report bugs, including video files that don’t work for you!*
        
        My File Won’t Play!
        -------------------
        
        Chromecasts are picky, and the built in media receiver doesn’t give any
        feedback regarding why it won’t play something. (It just flashes and
        quits on the main TV.) If your file won’t play, please click the info
        button:
        
        .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2049665/66446007-978b5780-e9fd-11e9-87cc-c01f07c67271.png

        And then the “Report File Doesn’t Play” button:
        
        .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2049665/66446040-b12c9f00-e9fd-11e9-8acf-b3bc0d28c971.png

        So I can fix it!

        Transcoding
        -----------
        
        Chromecasts only support a handful of media formats. See:
        https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media
        
        So some amount of transcoding is necessary if your video files don’t
        conform. But we’re smart about it. If you have an ``.mkv`` file with
        ``h264`` video and ``AAC`` audio, we use ``ffmpeg`` to simply rewrite
        the container (to ``.mp4``) without touching the underlying streams,
        which my XPS 13 can at around 100x realtime (it’s fully IO bound).
        
        Now if you have that same ``.mkv`` file with and ``A3C`` audio stream
        (which Chromecast doesn’t support) we’ll rewrite the container, copy the
        ``h264`` stream as is and only transcode the audio (at about 20x).
        
        If neither your file’s audio or video streams are supported, then it’ll
        do a full transcode (at around 5x).
        
        We write the entire transcoded file to your ``/tmp`` directory in order
        to make scrubbing fast and glitch-free, a good trade-off IMO. Hopefully
        you’re not running your drive at less than one video’s worth of free
        space!
        
        Subtitles
        ---------
        
        Chromecast only supports a handful of subtitle formats, ``.srt`` not
        included. But it does support
        `WebVTT <https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/>`__. So we extract whatever
        subtitles are in your video, convert them to WebVTT, and then reattach
        them to the video through Chomecast’s API.
