GOV.UK Bank Holidays
====================

Usage
-----

Install using ``pip install govuk-bank-holidays``. Sample usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from govuk_bank_holidays.bank_holidays import BankHolidays

    bank_holidays = BankHolidays()
    for bank_holiday in bank_holidays.get_holidays():
        print(bank_holiday['title'], '>', bank_holiday['date'])
    print(bank_holidays.get_next_holiday())

    # choose a different locale for holiday titles and notes
    bank_holidays = BankHolidays(locale='cy')

Bank holidays differ around the UK. The GOV.UK source currently lists these for 3 "divisions":

- England and Wales
- Scotland
- Northern Ireland

â€¦ and many methods in this library take a ``division`` parameter (c.f. constants on ``BankHolidays`` class).

NB: If no division is specified, only holidays common to *all* divisions are returned.
