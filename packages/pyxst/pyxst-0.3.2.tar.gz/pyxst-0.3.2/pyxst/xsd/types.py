class XsdType(XsdNode):
    """
    Abstract class representing a type defined in an XML Schema.

    Two different types can be defined: simple types that only contain textual
    data or complex types that can contain attributes or elements. In an XML
    Schema, it is also possible to define types that are derived from other 
    types (they use the definition of the other type and add or remove
    some content or some constraints).

    After all the types have been read, it is possible to resolve the 
    derivation hierarchy ie propagate in each type the information stored
    in the types it is derived from (see ``resolve_derivation`` method).

    If a type is directly defined inside an element, a name is nevertheless 
    automatically created for this type.

    .. attribute:: content_type

       Type of the content that can be found in the type. If the type is a 
       simple type or a complex type with a simple content, the content is 
       purely textual and therefore this attribute will give the built-in type 
       of this content (string, float, date, etc.)

       If the type is a simple list type or a simple union type, this attribute
       is left emptycomplex type with
       complex content, the content can either be ``ELEMENTS_ONLY`` or
       ``MIXED`` (a mixed content is a content that mixes textual data
       and child elements).

    .. attribute:: derivation_resolved

       Flag set to true after the derivation of this type has been resolved.
       When the derivation is resolved, all the information inherited from the
       base type has been propagated in this type.

    .. attribute:: constraints

       Constraints applied to the base type this type is
       derived from.  Different sorts of constraints can be
       defined. They are stored in a dictionary whose key is the name
       of the constraint (name of the XML constraint element in the
       XML Schema). The possible names of constraints are:
       ``minExclusive``,``minInclusive``, ``maxExclusive``,
       ``maxInclusive``, ``totalDigits``, ``fractionDigits``,
       ``length``, ``minLength``, ``maxLength``, ``enumeration``,
       ``whiteSpace``, ``pattern``.

       Only types whose content is purely textual (simple types or complex
       types with simple content) can have constraints.

       Type: Dictionary of 
       :class:`~pyxst.xml_struct.xsd.constraints.XsdConstraint` 
       indexed with :class:`unicode`

    .. attribute:: _base_type

       Base type that this type is derived from. The derivation method
       is defined with ``_derivation_method`` attribute.

       This attribute is private as it is not necessary to read the information
       in the base type after the derivation of this type has been resolved.

       Type: :class:`~pyxst.xml_struct.xsd.types.XsdType`

    .. attribute:: _deriv_method

       Method of derivation used to define this type from its base type 
       declared in ``_base_type`` attribute. The possible values for this
       attribute are ``RESTRICTION`` and ``EXTENSION``.

       This attribute is private as it is not necessary to read the information
       in the base type after the derivation of this type has been resolved.
