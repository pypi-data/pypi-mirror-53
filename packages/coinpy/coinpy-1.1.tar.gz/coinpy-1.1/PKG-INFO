Description: # Coinpy
        
        Coinpy is a package to handle distribution data. There's a specific focus on gaussian and binomial distributions
        
        Functions include returning the mean, standard deviation and plots of given dataset. You can also use coinpy to import data and add gaussian curves.
        
        Made with assistance of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) during the data science course in object-oriented programming.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install coinpy.
        
        ```bash
        pip install coinpy
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import coinpy
        
        gaussian_one = Gaussian()
        
        gaussian_one.read_data_file('numbers.txt', True)
        # read .txt file from local directory
        
        gaussian_one.calculate_mean()
        # returns and stores float mean 25 for example
        
        gaussian_one.calculate_stdev()
        # returns and stores standard dev 2 for example
        
        gaussian_one.pdf(5)
        # given x (or 5) returns prob density function 0.19947
        
        gaussian_one.plot_histogram_pdf()
        # returns normalized histogram and prob density function
        
        ```
