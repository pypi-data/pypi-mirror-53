# sotabench-api

Easily benchmark machine learning models on selected tasks and datasets.

This is a core package with common functions and APIs to interact with the
[sotabench](https://sotabench.com) website. 

For benchmarks, see the
[torchbench](https://github.com/paperswithcode/torchbench) repository with
PyTorch benchmarks (more frameworks to come soon).
