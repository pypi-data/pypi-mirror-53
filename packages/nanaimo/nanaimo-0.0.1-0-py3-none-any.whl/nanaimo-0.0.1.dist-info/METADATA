Nanaimo: Hardware-In-the-Loop CI Testing

*It's the delicious custard between your Continuous-Integration pipeline and your HIL test fixtures.*

.. Note::
    `Nanimo bars`_ are about the best things humans have ever invented. This
    test runner isn't as wonderful as the dessert but we hope it does bring
    a small smile to your face.

The :code:`nait` script is designed as a glue between CI automation like
`buildkite`_ or `jenkins`_ and a micro-controller test fixture physically
attached to a build host. This project may evolve over time to become more
generalized but for now we're starting small.

To use the current version of the :code:`nait` script simply produce `JLink Commander`_
scripts and hex files in one stage of your CI pipeline and deliver these
and nanaimo to a physical host your HIL rig is attached to.

*Example of a Segger* `JLink EDU`_ *attached to an NXP S32K144EVB being used by nanaimo*

Example::

    nait -vv \
     --port \
     /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Signoid_Kft._USB-UART_adapter_MACX98-if00-port0 \
     --port-speed 115200 \
     *.jlink

JLink
***********************************

This version of nanaimo does require a segger JLink and the Segger JLinkExe tool. Nanaimo
uses JLinkExe to upload binaries and to reset the test target.

.. Note::
    There is no plan to support OpenSDA as its mass storage upload solution
    does not have a portable API for resetting the target.

In the future we plan on adding support for `OpenOCD`_ and `pyOCD`_ both of which provide a
portable API to a large set of micro-controllers but JLink is the industry standard and the
`JLink EDU Mini`_ is an inexpensive probe (about $20 USD) with free software available for
linux, mac, and Windows that can be used for non-commercial purposes. For open source projects
this seems like an ideal solution.
