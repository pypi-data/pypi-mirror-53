Description: # pyOrganize
        
        An automated folder organizer in Python.</br>
        It runs in the background and watches for new files created by the user and moves it to it's folder(Images/Documents/Vides,etc), depending on the extension of the file. 
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        It needs __watchdog__ module to trigger an event when a new file is created.
        
        ```
        sudo pip install watchdog
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        
        Run it on your local machine by passing the name of the User Account in Linux.
        
        ```
        python main.py vishnu
        ```
        where, _vishnu_ is the username of my system.
        
        That's it!
        
        
        ## Adding more file formats
        
        Just copy and edit any of the _if_ statement inside the proccess method in the eventHandler class.
        
        eg, to organise .C files, add this snippet
        
        ```
        
            elif ".c" in event.src_path:
                    fileName=event.src_path.replace(pathDownloads,"")
                    os.rename(pathDownloads+fileName,pathDownloads+"C_programs"+fileName)   
        ```
