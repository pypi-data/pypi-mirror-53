Description: 
        # Im2ascii
        A small python project that transforms images into ascii text
        
        First of all import the package with:
        ````
        pip install im2ascii
        ````
        now import the package to your code:
        ````
        import im2ascii
        ````
        Now lets use it!
        
        The only function is asciify, see:
        ````
        im2ascii.asciify("/full/path/to/image.png")
        ````
        This will return your image except it is typed in ascii characters!
        
        ### Aditional Parameters
        There are only two aditional paramters for the function, square and invert. 
        The square parameter makes sure your image is returned squared and not a rectangle. This is activated by default on the function, to deactivate it just use:
        ````
        asciify('image.png', square=False)
        ````
        
        The invert parameter invert the tones on the result of the image. like so:
        For white tones, a '.' will be added, and for darker tones, a '@' will be the result. if you use ``invert=True``, this will be inverted.
