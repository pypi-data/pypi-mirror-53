Description: Virtual Reference Coil
        ======================
        
        Python implementation of the algorithm described in [1]_ for finding
        optimal phase map estimates using a constructed virtual coil.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Should be as easy as a pip install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install virtcoilphase
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Examples can be called from the command line, for example:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            python -m virtcoilphase.examples.simple
        
        Given a number of coil images, you can find the absolute phase
        estimate like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from virtcoilphase import virtcoilphase
            phase = virtcoilphase(x, coil_axis=-1)
