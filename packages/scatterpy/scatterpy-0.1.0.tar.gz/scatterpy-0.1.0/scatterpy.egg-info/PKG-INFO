Description: Python module to calculate scattering amplitude and phase matrices of
        rotationally symmetric particles based on the T-matrix method.
        
        Based on the original Fortran T-matrix code by Mishchenko.
        Currently spheroids, Chebyshev shapes and generalized chebyshev shapes are
        implemented. Also includes several empirical dropshapes.
