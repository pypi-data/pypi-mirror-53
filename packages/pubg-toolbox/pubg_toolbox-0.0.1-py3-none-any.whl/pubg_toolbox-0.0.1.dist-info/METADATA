# pubg-toolbox

A set of APIs that are used for my personal projects. There are already a bunch of awesome utils online such as [pubg-python](https://github.com/ramonsaraiva/pubg-python/blob/master/README.md), however I found them doesn't really fit my needs and customize it could take a while.

## How to Use

### Client
Creating a client is easy
```
client = PUBGClient('<API key>')
```

### Player
```
data = client.request(PlayerQuery('<id>', '<platform>'))
player = Player(data)
```

### Seasons
```
data = client.request(SeasonsQuery('<platform>'))
seasons = Seasons(data)
```

### Matches
```
data = client.request(MatchesQuery('<account id>', '<season is>'))
matches = Matches(data)
```

### Match
```
data = client.request(MatchQuery('<match id>'))
player = Player(data)
```

### Telemetry
Telemetry is a bit more complicated as you need get a match first.
With the Match object created from above, use `get_telemetry_url` to get the telemtry CDN url.
```
data = client.request(TelemetryQuery('<telemetry url>'))
```
Then use event class to deal with each telemetry.
