Description: # pubg-toolbox
        A set of API wrappers to query PUBG game data according to [official APIs](https://documentation.pubg.com/en/introduction.html#json-api), read it to learn more details.
        
        Essentially the APIs needed, at least for my project, provide simple ways to get get pubg data in json format given the `player name`, `platform` and `season`. As for what to process with the obtained data, they are up to use cases. Therefore this toolbox focus on getting the data easily.
        
        ## Goal 0.1:
        * Complete APIs listed to get json data in an easy and stable manner
        * Exception handling for query failure
        * API names clean up
        * Tests complete
        
        ## Goal 0.2:
        * Add APIs to retrieve frequently used data from json returned
        
        ## How to Use
        
        ### Client
        Creating a client is easy
        ```
        from pubg_toolbox.client import PUBGClient
        client = PUBGClient('<API key>')
        ```
        
        ### Player
        ```
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.queries import PlayerQuery
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.types import Player
        
        data = client.request(PlayerQuery('<id>', '<platform>'))
        player = Player(data)
        ```
        Get recent played match ids
        ```
        player.matches
        ```
        
        ### Seasons
        ```
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.queries import SeasonsQuery
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.types import Seasons
        
        data = client.request(SeasonsQuery('<platform>'))
        seasons = Seasons(data)
        ```
        
        Get a list of season ids by
        ```
        seasons.get_all_seasons()
        ```
        
        Get current season id by
        ```
        seasons.get_current_season()
        ```
        
        ### Matches
        ```
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.queries import MatchesQuery
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.types import Matches
        
        data = client.request(MatchesQuery('<account id>', '<season is>'))
        matches = Matches(data)
        ```
        
        Get match ids per game modeby
        ```
        matches.get_matches('matchesSolo')
        
        ```
        
        ### Match
        ```
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.queries import MatchQuery
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.types import Match
        
        data = client.request(MatchQuery('<match id>'))
        match = Match(data)
        ```
        The most important feature is to get the telemetry url so we can look further into it:
        ```
        match.get_telemetry_url()
        ```
        
        You can also get useful information such as
        ```
        match.created_at # match date
        match.get_match_map() # match map
        match.get_game_mode() # match game mode
        ```
        
        ### Telemetry
        Telemetry is a bit more complicated as you need get a match first.
        With the Match object created from above, use `get_telemetry_url` to get the telemtry CDN url.
        ```
        from pubg_toolbox.data_types.queries import TelemetryQuery
        
        data = client.request(TelemetryQuery('<telemetry url>'))
        ```
