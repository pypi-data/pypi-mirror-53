Description: ISIC
        ====
        
        This is just a Python-friendly way to reference revision 4 of the International
        Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC).  It's the result of pulling down
        `this URL`_ and formatting it into a native Python object.  For more
        information, or to see this data in other original source formats, visit the UN
        `here`_.

        How Do I Use It?
        ----------------
        
        It's really not very advanced.  Just import it and reference it however you
        like:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from isic import ISIC
        
        
            print(ISIC["02"])  # "Forestry and logging"
            print(ISIC["B"])  # "Mining and quarrying"
        
        It's also handy if you want to use it in a Django model:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.db import models
            from isic import ISIC
        
        
            class MyModel(models.Model):
                industry = models.CharField(max_length=5, choices=ISIC.items())
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It's on PyPi, so just install it with pip.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ pip install isic
