The python package to parse TFLite models
=========================================

This `tflite` pip package is built from the `schema.fbs` of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) with [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).

## Usage

Using this package, you can parse the TFLite models (`*tflite`) in Python. One target of this package is to let people use it as the one originally built from `schema.fbs`. ~~The versions is managed mirrored with TensorFlow, e.g. `v1.14.0`, though only few versions are supported.~~ `v1.14.0` is the default supported version at this time.

This package has been published on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/), `pip install tflite` will install it. Basically, the usage styles include:

* Easy import which avoids too many imports per submodules ([example](tests/test_easy_import.py)): `import tflite`. This is also the recommanded way to use this package.
* Nested tflite modules `tflite.tflite` as it is the originally built one ([example](tests/test_nested_import.py)): `from tflite.tflite.Model import Model`. This is as a workaround when encountering bug in easy import.

The *easy import* imports the classes and functions of one submodules into top module directly, e.g. translating the `{package}.{submodules}.{class or function}` to `{package}.{class or function}`. For example, when building the `Model` object, `tflite.Model.GetRootAsModel(buf, 0)` should be used rather than `tflite.Model.Model.GetRootAsModel(buf, 0)`. This should be much easy to use. Look into the [tests](tests) for more examples.


## Development

To develop this package, additional depdendency can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The [`tools`](tools) directory holds some scripts to update the package to corresponding TensorFlow version. Features could be added to make the parsing easy in the future.

Don't forget to re-install the newly built `tflite` package before testing it. You may also try `source tools/source-me.sh` rather than the annoying build and install process in development.
