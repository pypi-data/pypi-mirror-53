Description: cmpGen is deprecated.
        Please just use the "key" parameter of sort/sorted instead.
        It is better in every conceivable way (faster, simpler, more legible, etc.)
        
        For example, here is the example below, but entirely using "key" instead:
        
        l=[3,0,1,-2,4,3,-5]
        l.sort(key=abs)
        l now is [0,1,-2,3,3,4,-5]
        
        This pakage is now here just to support legacy version of packages that used this
        
        
        Old README for reference:
        -------------------------
        
        cmpGen is a very simple utility to aid in sorting.
        Basically, I often want to sort a list based on a specific property
        or more generically a function of the values in the list.
        cmpGen acts as a middle layer to make this process simple.
        
        Usage:
        l is a list
        l.sort(cmpGen(someFunctionThatActsOnListElements))
        
        Example 1: Sort a list of 2-integer pairs based on second element in the pair:
        l=[[3,3],[1,6],[0,12],[1,1],[7,4],[6,7]]
        l.sort(cmpGen(lambda x: x[1]))
        l is now [[1, 1], [3, 3], [7, 4], [1, 6], [6, 7], [0, 12]]
        
        Example 2: Sort based on the absolute value of list elements:
        l=[3,0,1,-2,4,3,-5]
        l.sort(cmpGen(abs))
        l now is [0,1,-2,3,3,4,-5]
