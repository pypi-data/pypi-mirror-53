Description: # PhotoDB
        
        PhotoDB is an app for film photography that can be used to track cameras, lenses, accessories, films, negatives and prints, to fully
        catalogue a collection of photographic equipment as well as the pictures that are made with them. Read the [Concepts](docs/CONCEPTS.md)
        section for full details on the capabilities of PhotoDB.
        
        ## Installing PhotoDB
        
        At the moment, PhotoDB is not packaged for production use. To install it in development mode, clone this repo and run:
        
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
        
        ## Configuring PhotoDB
        
        PhotoDB will run out of the box with no additional configuration, by creating an SQLite database in its own directory.
        
        If you wish to use an external database then copy `photodb/local_settings.py.template` to
        `photodb/local_settings.py` and customise the database settings for your environment.
