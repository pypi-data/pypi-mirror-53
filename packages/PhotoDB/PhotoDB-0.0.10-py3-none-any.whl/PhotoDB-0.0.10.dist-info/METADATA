# PhotoDB

PhotoDB is an app for film photography that can be used to track cameras, lenses, accessories, films, negatives and prints, to fully
catalogue a collection of photographic equipment as well as the pictures that are made with them. Read the [Concepts](docs/CONCEPTS.md)
section for full details on the capabilities of PhotoDB.

## Installing PhotoDB

At the moment, PhotoDB is not packaged for production use. To install it in development mode, clone this repo and run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate

```

## Configuring PhotoDB

PhotoDB will run out of the box with no additional configuration, by creating an SQLite database in its own directory.

If you wish to use an external database then copy `photodb/local_settings.py.template` to
`photodb/local_settings.py` and customise the database settings for your environment.
