# ZCross

ZCross is a python library used to read low pressure gas sections from various sources like [LXCat](https://lxcat.net/home/).

## Installation

To install this package just use pip:
``` shell
pip install zcross
```

After installing it is necessary to download the cross-section databases. As today, only the [LXCat](https://lxcat.net/home/) dataset is available.

After downloading the database, uncompress and copy to a shared directory such as:
``` shell
/opt/zcross-data/
```
and configure the `$ZCROSS_DATA` enviroment variable in your `.bashrc` or in `/etc/profile.d/zcross.sh`
``` shell
export ZCROSS_DATA=/opt/zcross-data/
```

Unfortunately, due licensing issues, **we are not able to distribute** the cross section database and we are closely working with the [LXCat](https://lxcat.net/home/) to make them available. Please contact the [authors](michele.renda@cern.ch) of this module for support or updates about the databases availability.

## Examples

List the database availables:
``` python
from zcross import ZCross

z = ZCross()
for database in z.databases:
	print(database)
```

Show the groups and references of a speficic database:
``` python
from zcross import ZCross

z = ZCross()
database = z.databases[0]

for group in database.groups:
	print(group)

for reference in database.references:
	print(reference.bibtex())
```

Show the process of a specific group:
``` python
from zcross import ZCross

z = ZCross()
database = z.databases[0]
group      = database.groups[0]

for process in group.processes:
	print("Process {} (type: {}) : {}".format(process.id, process.collisionType, process))
	print("Comment: {}\n".format(process.comment))
```

Show the cross section table of a specific process:
``` python
from zcross import ZCross

z = ZCross()
database = z.databases[0]
group    = database.groups[0]
process  = group.processes[0]

print('Energy [{}],\tArea [{}]'.format(process.energy_units, process.cross_section_units))

for energy, area in zip(process.energy, process.cross_section):
	print('{:8.2f}\t{:e}'.format(energy, area))
```
