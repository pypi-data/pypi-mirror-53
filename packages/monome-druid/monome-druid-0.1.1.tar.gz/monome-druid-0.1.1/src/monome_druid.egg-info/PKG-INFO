Description: # druid
        
        A basic REPL for crow with some utilities
        
        ## Setup
        
        Requirements:
        - Python 3.5+
          - Windows & OS X: https://www.python.org/downloads/
          - Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip` or equivalent
        - `pip` and `setuptools`
        - `pyserial` and `prompt_toolkit`
        
        Note: you might need to use `python` and `pip` instead of `python3` and `pip3` depending on your platform. If `python3` is not found, check that you have python >= 3.5 with `python --version`.
        
        Install and run:
        ```bash
        # Ensure setuptools is up to date
        pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
        # Install druid
        pip3 install .
        # Run druid :)
        druid
        ```
        
        ## Druid
        
        Start by running `druid`
        
        - type q (enter) to quit.
        - type h (enter) for a list of special commands.
        
        - input values are printed on the top line
        - will reconnect to crow after a disconnect / restart
        - scrollable console history
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        druid
        //// druid. q to quit. h for help
        
        > x=6
        
        > print(x)
        6
        
        > output[1].volts = 0
        
        > q
        ```
        
        Execute a lua script and enter the REPL from the command line:
        ```
        druid examples/test-2.lua
        ```
        
        Diagnostic logs are written to `druid.log`.
        
        ## Upload
        
        ```
        python3 upload.py examples/test-2.lua
        ```
        
        Uploads the provided lua file to crow & stores it in flash to be executed on boot.
        
        ## Download
        
        ```
        python3 download.py
        ```
        
        Prints to screen.
        Copy to file by running:
        
        ```
        python3 download.py > feathers.lua
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        Druid comes with a bunch of example scripts to help introduce crow's syntax, and spur your imagination with some zany ideas. Here's the list with a brief description of each (most scripts have a longer description including the assignment of ins and outs at the top of the script):
        
        - `boids.lua`: four simulated birds that fly around your input
        - `booleanlogic.lua`: logic gates determined by two input gates
        - `clockdiv.lua`: four configurable clock divisions of the input clock
        - `cvdelay.lua`: a control voltage delay with four taps & looping option
        - `gingerbread.lua`: clocked chaos generators
        - `samplehold.lua`: sample and hold with quantization & randomness
        - `seqswitch.lua`: route an input to 1 of 4 outputs with optional 'hold'
        - `shiftregister.lua`: output the last 4 captured voltages & play just friends
        - `stop.lua`: reset crow
