Description: # eurec4a_snd
        
        This package is ment to help in establishing a common radiosonde output format.
        During the EUREC4A/ATOMIC campagne many radiosondes will be launched and an unique fileformat incl. unique variables names will hopefully help there community.
        
        Currently, this package contains a script to convert radiosonde datafile of the `MW41` to netCDF files.
        
        Simply run `sounding_converter -i your_sounding.dat` after the installation. During the first execution you will be asked to give meta-information which will be included in the output files.
        
        These include e.g. `contact_person` and `platform` name which are probably helpful after the exchange of these files with other scientists.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed with `conda` (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/):
        
        The best option is to create a new environment to not run into dependency problems with pre-installed package:
        
        ```bash
        conda create --name field_campaign
        ```
        
        Activate the new environment with
        
        ```bash
        conda activate field_campaign
        ```
        
        The actual package can than be installed with
        ```bash
        conda install -c observingclouds eurec4a_snd
        ```
        
        ## First execution
        
        During the first execution, the `meta_information.ini` configuration file has to be created. The user is prompted some questions on the command line before the file will be written to the users home directory.
        
        It is also possible to copy the `config/meta_information_template.ini` to ones favorite folder and change the files content accordingly. If the file in not renamed `meta_information.ini` and is in the home directory, the option `-c` has to be used during calling `sounding_converter` otherwise it will not recognize the configuration.
        
        ```python
        sounding_convert -i your_sounding.dat -c /your/path/to/meta_information.ini
        ```
        
        ## Visualization
        ### Panoply
        The converted dat files are netCDF files which conform to the CF-Conventions as far as possible and make use of the `discrete sampling geometry`. The sounding data can therefore easily be drawn as trajectories without extra efforts.

        ### Simple Plotting
        The package also includes a few plotting routines that can be called with e.g.
        
        ```bash
        sounding_visualize -n converted/file/sounding.nc
        ```
        
        ## Example
        
        Examples of the input `.dat` file and the converted `.nc` file can be found in `examples/data`.
        
        ## Tipps and tricks
        
        - Commands `sounding_convert` and `sounding_visualize` cannot be found!
          It seems something went wrong with the installation via `conda`. Although it is recommended to install this package via anaconda because it comes with the benefit that all dependencies should be resolved. However, you can also download this git repository and run within the `eurec4a_snd` folder:
          
          ```bash
          python L1_rs41.py -i your_sounding.dat
          ```
          or for the quicklooks
          
          ```bash
          python make_quicklooks_rs41.py -n converted/file/sounding.nc
          ```
