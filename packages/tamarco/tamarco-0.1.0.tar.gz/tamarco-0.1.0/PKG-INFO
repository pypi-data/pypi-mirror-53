Description: # Tamarco
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/System73/tamarco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/System73/tamarco)
        
        Microservices framework designed for asyncio and Python.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Lifecycle management.
        * Standardized settings via etcd.
        * Automatic logging configuration. Support for sending logs to an ELK stack.
        * Application metrics via Prometheus. 
        * Designed for asyncio.
        * Messaging patterns. The framework comes with support for AMQP and Kafka via external resources. The AMQP resource has 
        implemented publish/subscribe, request/response and push/pull patterns. 
        * Custom encoders and decoders. 
        * Pluging oriented architecture. Anyone can create a new resource to add new functionality. External resources are integrated 
        into the framework transparently for the user.
        * Graceful shutdown.
        
        ## Resources
        
        The framework allows to write external resources and integrate them in the lifecycle of a microservice easily. List with
         the available resources:
        
        * Metrics.
        * Registry.
        * Status.
        * Profiler.
        * Memory analizer.
        * HTTP.
        * Kafka. Not released yet.
        * AMQP. Not released yet.
        * Postgres. Not released yet.
        * Influxdb. Not released yet.
        * Redis. Not released yet.
        * Websocket. Not released yet.
        
        Let us know if you have written a resource.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Can be built doing a `make docs`. It will be publicly available soon.
        
        ## Examples
        
        There are several examples in the `examples` folder.
        
        To run them, install tamarco, launch the docker-compose (not necessary for all the examples) and run it.
        
        ```python3
        pip install tamarco
        docker-compose up -d
        python examples/http_resource/microservice.py
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Support for Python >= 3.6.
