        ### Providing feedback
        
        Beneath is just entering public beta, so there's bound to be some rough edges. Bugs, feature requests, suggestions â€“ we'd love to hear about them. To file an issue, [click here](https://gitlab.com/_beneath/beneath-python/issues).
        
        ### Developing the library
        
        - Make sure Python 3 is installed and available as `python3`
        - Initialize and source the Python virtual environment with `./init-venv.sh`
        - Run tests with `pytest` (though it's sparse on tests at moment)
        - Run `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment and `source .env/bin/activate` to re-activate it
        - For use in VS Code, open `beneath-python` as a workspace root folder. Press `CMD+Shift+P`, search for `Python: Select Interpreter`, and select the Python 3 executable in the `.env` virtual environment.
