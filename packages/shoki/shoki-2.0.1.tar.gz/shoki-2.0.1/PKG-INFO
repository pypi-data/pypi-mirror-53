        shoki is a secretary in Japanese. This python program is here to help take a text-only file of meeting minutes and convert it into structured data. This structured data can then be converted into other formats.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install shoki
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        shoki create --location [uri]
        ```
        
        where `uri` is the location of the content served with a `Content-Type: text/markdown` or `Content-Type: text/plain` encoded as utf-8.
        
        
        ### Example
        
        ```bash
        shoki create --location https://webcompat-meet.herokuapp.com/0CMnUyYMSBaQJQ97Yxc8Ww/download
        ```
        
        ## History
        
        It was initially defined for addressing the needs of [Mozilla webcompat team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility). It's strongly inspired by W3C meetings style. We are [taking minute](https://webcompat-meet.herokuapp.com/0CMnUyYMSBaQJQ97Yxc8Ww) of our meetings on CodiMD. Once the meeting has been done. We generate the minutes with a mediawiki format that we add to the [list of our meetings](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Meetings).
        
        Example: [Web Compatibility team minutes - September 11, 2018](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Meetings/2018-09-11) ([raw source](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Compatibility/Meetings/2018-09-11&action=edit))
