    A bug in the ``amqp`` python library can cause the connection to the
    RabbitMQ broker to hang when using SSL/TLS. This results in
    frequent errors such as this::

      MessagingTimeout: Timed out waiting for a reply to message ID ae039d1695984addbfaaef032ce4fda3

    (see `bug 1800957
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.messaging/+bug/1800957>`_).

    This bug has been fixed in `v2.4.1 of amqp
    <https://github.com/celery/py-amqp/commit/bf122a05a21a8cc5bca314b0979f32c8026fc66e>`_.

    It is recommended that deployments using SSL/TLS upgrade the amqp
    library to v2.4.1 or later.
