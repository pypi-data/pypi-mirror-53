These standing near to the stern of the ship were buying of the wares such as pleased them most, when of a sudden the Phenicians, passing the word from one to another, made a rush upon them; and the greater part of the women escaped by flight, but Io and certain others were carried off.

Without commerce, without freedom of communication either by land or sea, cultivating no more of their territory than the exigencies of life required, destitute of capital, never planting their land (for they could not tell when an invader might not come and take it all away, and when he did come they had no walls to stop him), thinking that the necessities of daily sustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another, they cared little for shifting their habitation, and consequently neither built large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness. The richest soils were always most subject to this change of masters; such as the district now called Thessaly, Boeotia, most of the Peloponnese, Arcadia excepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest of Hellas. The goodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular individuals, and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of ruin. It also invited invasion. \\nAccordingly Attica, from the poverty of its soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never changed its inhabitants. And here is no inconsiderable exemplification of my assertion that the migrations were the cause of there being no correspondent growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war or faction from the rest of Hellas took refuge with the Athenians as a safe retreat; and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the already large population of the city to such a height that Attica became at last too small to hold them, and they had to send out colonies to Ionia. \\n\\n', 'mhb', '20190818_202655']" .

Finally, just before the war between Athens and Sparta, the democratic party droe out the aristocratic party, who then went over to the foreign enemies of the city and joined them in making piratical attacks on it both by sea and by land. The democrats inside the city now found themselves in difficulties and sent an embassy to Corcyra, begging their mother country not to allow them to perish, and asking for help both in making some settlement with the exiled party and in putting an end to the war with the foreigners.

On the contrary, your idea of proper behaviour is, firstly, to avoid harming others, and then to avoid being harmed yourselves, even if it is a matter of defending your own interests. Even if you had on your frontiers a power holding the same principles as you do, it is hard to see how such a policy could have been a success. But at the present time, as we have hast pointed out to you, your whole way of life is out of date when compared with theirs. And it is just as true in politics as it is in any art or craft: new methods must drive out old ones. When a city can live in peace and quiet, no doubt the old-established ways are best: but when one is constantly being faced by new problems, one has also to be capable of approaching them in an original way. Thus Athens, because of the very variety of her experince, is a far more modern state than you are. \\n'Your inactivity has done harm enough. Now let there be an end o it.

In the later invasion, when we were unable to meet the enemy on land, we and all our people took to our ships, and joined in the battle at Salamis. It was this battle that prevented the Persians from sailing aginst the Peloponnese and destroying the cities one by one; for no system of mutual defence could have been organized in face of the Persians naval superioirty. The best proof of this is in the conduct of the Persians themselevs. Once they had lost the battle at sea they realised that their force was crippled and they inmmediately withdrew most of their army.\", 'mhb', '20190824_203730']" .

It has always been a rule that the weak should be subject to the strong; and besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up till the present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now, after calculating your own interst, you ar ebeginning to talk in terms of right and wrong.

If you take somthing on before you are ready for it, hurry at the beginning will mean delay at the end. Besides, the city in which we live has always been free and always famous. \"Slow\" and \"cautious\" can equally well be \"wise\" and \"sensible\". Certainly it is because we possess these qualitites that we are the only people who do not become arrogant when we are successful, and who in times of stress are less likely to give in than others.  We are not carried away by the pleasure of hearing ourselves praised when people are urging us towards dangers that seem to us unnecessary; and we are no more likely to give in shamefacedly to other people\\'s views when they try to spur us on by their accusations. Because of our well-ordered life we are both brave in war and wise in council. Brave, because self-control is based upon a sense of honour, and honour is based on courage. And we are wise because we are not so highly educated as to look down upon our laws and customs, and are too rigorously trained in self control to be able to disobey them. We are trained to avoid being too clever in matters that are of no use -- such as being able to produce an excellent theoretical criticsm of one\\'s enemies\\' dispositions, and then failing in practice to do quite so well aginst them. Instead we are taught that there is not a great deal of difference between the way we think and the way others think, and that it is impossible to calculate accurately events that are determined by chance. The practical measures that we take are always based on the assumption that our enemies are not unintelligent. And it is right and proper for us to put our hopes in the reliability of our own precations rather than in the possibility of our opponent making mistakes.

This was bcause he wanted to make them show their opinions openly and so make them all the more enthusiastic for war. He therefore said: 'Sparatans, those of you who think that the treaty has been broken and that the Athenians are aggressors, get up and stand on one side Those who do not think so, stand on the other side,' and he pointed out to them where they were to stand. They the rose to their feet and separated into two divisions. The great majority were of the opinion that the treaty had been broken. They then summoned their allies to the assembly and told them that they had decided that Athens was acting aggressively, but that they wanted to have all their allies with them when they put the vote, so that, if they decided to make war, it should be done on the basis of a unanimous resolution.\\nAfterwards the allied delegates, having got their own way, returned home. Later the Athenian representatives, when they had finished the business for which they had come, also returned. This decision of the assembly that the treaty had been broken took place in the fourteenth year of the thirty years' truce which was made after the affair of Euboea. The Spartans voted that the treaty had been broken and that war should be declared not so much because they were influenced by the speeches of their allies as because they were afraid of the further growth of Athenian power, seeing, as they did, that already the greater part of Hellas was under the control of Athens.\", 'mhb', '20190913_160458']" .

This was partly because they themselves did not like the idea of Athens or any other city being fortified, but chiefly becaues they were urged on by their allies, who were alramed both by the sudden growth of Athenian sea-power and by the daring which the Athenians had shown in the war against the Persians. The Spartans proposed that not only should Athens refrain from building her own fortifications, but that she should join them in pulling down all the fortifications which still existed in cities outside the Peloponnese. In making this suggestion to the Athenians they concealed their real meaning and their real fears;  the idea as, they said, that if there was another Persian invasion, the Persians would have nos trong base from which to operate,such as they had in Themes; and that the Peloponese was capable of serving the needs of everyone, both as a place of refuge and as a place from which to attack.\\nAfter this speech from the Spartans, the Athenians, on the advice of Themistocles, immediately sent them away with the reply that they would send an embassy to discuss the points that had been raised. Themistocles then proposed that they should wait until they had built their fortificaitons high enough to be able to be defended. Meanwhile the whole population of the city was to work at building the walls; no private house or public building which might be of any use to the work was to be spared, but must in every case be demolished.\\nSo Themistocles set off, leaving these instructions behind him and indicating that he himself would arrange everything else that needed arranging in Sparta. When he arrived everything else that needed arranging in Sparta. When he arrived there he did not approach the Spartan government, but kept on putting things off on various excuses. If anyone in authority asked him why he did not come before the Assembly, he replied that he was waiting for his colleagues, that they had not been able to leave Athens because of urgent business, but that he expected them to come soon and was surprised that they had not arrived already.', 'mhb', '20190913_161906']" .

The foundations are made of different sorts of stone, something not shaped so as to fit, but laid down just as each was brought up at the time; there are many pillars taken from tombs and fragments of sculpture mixed in with the rest. For the city boundaries were extended on all sides, and so in their haste they used everything that came to hand, sparing nothing.\\nThemistocles also persuaded them to complete the walls of Piraeus, which had been begun previouly during his year of office as achon. He liked the position of the place, with its three natural harbours, and he considered that if Athenians became a seafaring people they would have every advantage in adding to their power. Indeed it was he who first ventured to tell the Athenians that their future was on the sea. Thus he at once begun to join in laying the foundations of their empire.\\nIn breadth the wall was built according to his specifications, just as one can see it today around Piraeus. There was room for two wagons to pass each other with their stones for the building, and the space in betwen the outer surfaces was not filled in with rubble or clay; instead large blocks of stone were cut and fitted together, with clamps of iron and lead on the outside. The height of the finiished wall was about half what he planned. With these great and thick walls he intended to repulse all enemy attacks, and he considersed that they could be perfectly well defended by a few troops of inferior quality, so that the rest would be ableto serve in the navy. It was particualrly on the navy that his thoughts were concentrated. He, realized, I imagine, that it was easier for a Persian force to approach Athens by sea than by land, and in his view Piraeus was a more valuable place than the main city of Athens. Indeed, the advice that he constantly gave to the Athenians was that if ever they should be hard pressed on land they should go down to Piraeus, take their ships, and defy all comers.', 'mhb', '20190914_084522']" .

Indeed, my view is that at this time the whole country was not even called \\'Hellas\\'. After Hellen and his sons had grown powerful in Phthiotis and had been invited as allies into other states, these states separately and because of their connections with the family of Hellen began to be called \"Hellenic.\" But it took a long time before the name ousted all other names. The bes evidence for this can be found in Homer, who though he was born much later than te time of the Trojan War, nowhere uses the name \\'Hellenic\\' for the whole force. Instead he keeps this name for the followers of Achilles who came from Phthiotis and were in fact the original Hellenes. For the rest in his poems he uses the words \\'Danaans\\', \\'Argives\\', and \\'Achaeans\\'. e does not even use th term \\'foreigners\\', and this, in my opinion, is because in his own time the Hellenses were not yet known by one name, and so marked off as something separate from the outside world. By \\'Hellenic\\' I mean here both those who took on the name city by city, as the result of a common language, and those who later were all called by the common name. In any case these various Hellenic states, weak in themselves and lacking in communications with one another, took no kind of collective action before the time of the Trojan War.

Suppose, for example, that the city of Sparta were to become deserted and that only the temples and foundations of buildings remained, I think hat future generations would, as time passed, find it very difficult to believe that the place had really been as powerful as it was represented to be. Yet the Spartans occupy two-fifths of the Peloponnese and stand at the head not only of the whole Peloponnese itself but also of numerous allies beyond its frontiers. Since, however, the city is not regularly planned and contains no temples or monuments of great magnificence, but is simply a collection of villages, in the ancient Hellenic way, its appearance would not come up to expectation. If, on the other hand, the same thing were to happen to Athens, one would conjecture from what met the eye that the city had been twice as powerful as in fact it is.', 'mhb', '20190821_232532']" .

People are inclined to accept all stories of ancient times in an uncritical way -- even when these stories concern their own native countries. Most people in Athens, for instance, are under the impression that Hipparchus, who was killed by Harmodius and Aristogiton, was tyrant at the time, not realizing that it was Hippias who was the eldest and the chief of the sons of Pisistratus, and that Hipparcus and Thessalus were his younger brothers. What happened was this: on the very day that had been fixed for their attempt, indeed at the very last moment, Harmodius and Aristogeiton had reason to believe that Hippias had been informed of the plot by some of the conspirators. believng him to have been forewarned, they kept away from him, but, as they wanted to perform some daring exploit before they were arrested themselves, they killed Hipparchus when they found him by the Leocorium organizing the Panathenaic procession.\\nThe rest of the Hellens, too, make many incorrect assumptions not only about the dimly remembered past, but also about contemporary history. For instance, there is a general belief that the kings of Sparta are each entailed to two votes, whereas in fact they have only one; and it is believed, too, that the Spartans have a company of troops called 'Pitanate'. Such a company has never existed. Most people, in fact, will not take trouble in finding out the truth, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear.\", 'mhb', '20190821_222748']" .
