# diffx #

This library was designed to compare two *.xml or *.json files. The main focus was to produce a intuitive interpretable *.svg output file. In future there will be a text export available, too. 

diffx was inspired by [X-Diff](http://www.inf.unibz.it/~nutt/Teaching/XMLDM1112/XMLDM1112Coursework/WangEtAl-ICDE2003.pdf "X-Diff: An Effective Change Detection Algorithm for XML Documents").

Since version 0.3.2 the distance cost's algorithm is replaced by parent-identification. This might by a wrong decision but the result's for huge xml documents (see. test 9) improved in performance and quality. 

This is not a bullet prove library (till now). It s more a playground to get in touch with comparing tree structures and presenting the resulting in a charming way.

## dependencies ##
 * PySide2
 * svgwrite
 * lxml
 * dicttoxml

## installation ##

```
python pip diffx
```

## fist step ##

### xml file example ###
```
from diffx import main

_xml1 = './simple/xml1.xml'
_xml2 = './simple/xml2.xml'

main.compare_xml(_xml1, _xml2)
main.save('./simple/diffx_file.svg')

```

### xml string example ###
```
from diffx import main

_xml1 = """<root><deleted>with content</deleted><unchanged/><changed name="test1" /></root>"""
_xml2 = """<root><unchanged/><changed name="test2" /><added/></root>"""

main.compare_xml(_xml1, _xml2)
main.save('./simple/diffx_string.svg')

```

### json file example ###
```
from diffx import main

json1 = './simple/xml1.json'
json2 = './simple/xml2.json'

main.compare_json(json1, json2)
main.save('./simple/diffx_file.svg')

```

# implementation #

 Each xml element is identified by it's xpath and a hash calculated by selecting relevant information. Start with the identification of huge xml blocks (changed/moved). Identification of parent elements by tag, text-pre, text-post, attribute-names and attribute-values. Parent xml blocks can contain further parent xml blocks.

```
 <tag attribute-name:"attribute-value" ...> 
 text-pre 
 	<... children ...>
 text-post
 </tag>
```

 1. mark all xml elements as changed
 1. iterate over parent blocks, starting with maximum children to parent blocks with less children
 1. mark unchanged xml elements of current parent
 1. mark moved xml elements of current parent
 1. mark xml elements identified by tag name and attribute names of the current parent
 1. mark xml elements identified by attributes values and element text of the current parent
 1. mark xml elements identified by tag name of the current parent
 1. mark xml elements with xpath that do not exist in the other xml tree as added/deleted of the current parent
 1. Repeat 3. till all xml elements are identified

All xml elements that are still marked as changed have to be investigated
