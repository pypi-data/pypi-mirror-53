# social ethosa
A Python library that uses requests

## Get started
Installation: `pip install --upgrade social-ethosa`  
Import:
```python
from social_ethosa import *
```

### Vkcom
```python
vk = Vk(token="Your token is here", group_id=12345, debug=True, lang="en")
# the group_id parameter should be used if you are going to log in through a group.
# In this example, we will use group authorization.

@vk.on_message_new
# This decorator is an event handler that executes the function passed to it on a new message
# The decorator's name is taken from the official names, but with the prefix " on_"
# https://vk.com/dev/groups_events
def getMessage(message):
  text = message.text
  peer_id = message.peer_id
  from_id = message.from_id
  attachments = message.attachments
```

using the file Uploader:
```python
vk.uploader.getUploadUrl("message_photo") # getting a link to upload files
# you can also pass other arguments (argument=value)
# to get the rest of the UploadUrl names, use the function
# uploader.getAllTypes
```
upload files:
```python
response = vk.uploader.uploadFile("path") # you can also pass other arguments (argument=value)
```

Some audio methods are also available in my library:
```python
login = "89007003535"
password = "qwertyuiop"

audio = Audio(login=login, password=password, debug=1)
audios = audio.get() # Since the audio methods are not available in the official API, I had to make a parser of the site
```
