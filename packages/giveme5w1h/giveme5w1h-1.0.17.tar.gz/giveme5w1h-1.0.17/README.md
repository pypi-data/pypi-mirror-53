Giveme5W1H is an open source, state of the art system that extracts phrases answering the journalistic 5W1H questions describing a news article's main event, i.e., who did what, when, where, why, and how? You can access the system through a simple RESTful API from any programming language or use it as a Python 3 library.

The figure below shows an excerpt of a news article with highlighted 5W1H phrases.

## Getting started
It's super easy, we promise!

### Installation
Giveme5W1H requires Python 3.6 (or later) to run. The following two commands will install Giveme5W1H and Stanford CoreNLP Server.
```
$ pip3 install giveme5w1h # Linux users may need to use: sudo -H pip3 install giveme5w1h
$ giveme5w1h-corenlp install
```

Test if the Stanford CoreNLP Server setup was successful:
```
$ giveme5w1h-corenlp
```
You should see `[main] INFO CoreNLP - StanfordCoreNLPServer listening at /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000` after a couple of seconds. Exit the program by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

### Extract 5W1H Phrases
Giveme5W1H enables the extraction of 5W1H phrases from news articles. You can access Giveme5W1H's functionality via a RESTful API, or as a module from within your Python 3.6+ code. 

#### Starting the CoreNLP Server (mandatory) 
You must always start the Stanford CoreNLP Server before using Giveme5W1H. To do so, run the following command in a terminal, and do not close the terminal:
```
$ giveme5w1h-corenlp
``` 

#### Use within your own code (as a library)
Use the following code to extract 5W1H phrases from a single news article.
```python
from Giveme5W1H.extractor.document import Document
from Giveme5W1H.extractor.extractor import MasterExtractor

extractor = MasterExtractor()
doc = Document.from_text(text, date_publish)
# or: doc = Document(title, lead, text, date_publish) 
doc = extractor.parse(doc)

top_who_answer = doc.get_top_answer('who').get_parts_as_text()
print(top_who_answer)
```

Have a look at our sample Python scripts, for more information on extraction from a [single news article](https://github.com/fhamborg/Giveme5W1H/blob/master/Giveme5W1H/examples/extracting/parse_single_from_code.py), or a [folder consisting of multiple JSON files in news-please format](https://github.com/fhamborg/Giveme5W1H/blob/master/Giveme5W1H/examples/extracting/parse_documents.py). To start one of them, use the following command (here shown for the `parse_documents` script, which extracts 5W1Hs from multiple JSON files):
```python
python3 -m Giveme5W1H.examples.extracting.parse_documents
```

#### RESTful API / webpage access
Start the RESTful API server that comes with Giveme5W1H (execute the following command in a separate shell, so that the CoreNLP Server started by the previous command runs in parallel):
```
$ giveme5w1h-rest
```
After a couple of seconds, you will see the following line:
```
 * Running on http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9099/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If you open the URL in your browser, you will see a page with a sample news article. Just click on `GET example`, or `run example` to analyze the shown article. You can also use this page to analyze your articles.

Of course, you can also access the RESTful API endpoints directly. You can access the endpoint at `http://localhost:9099/extract` via GET or POST requests. For GET and POST requests, the input format is the [news-please article format](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please/blob/master/newsplease/examples/sample.json), with the following fields:
* `title` (mandatory; can also be used to pass the full text of the article, e.g., if you do not have title, description, and text separately)
* `description` (typically the lead paragraph)
* `text` (the main text)
* `date` (must be readable by [parsedatetime](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parsedatetime/), e.g., `2017-07-17 17:03:00`)
* `url` (mandatory for POST requests)

# Additional Information
This section is currently subject to a major update. Some information may be outdated or redundant to the above information.

## Why do I need to start the Stanford CoreNLP Server manually?
We decided to not integrate the CoreNLP Server transparently into Giveme5W1H mainly because the CoreNLP Server takes a lot of time until the initialization of all components is finished. Hence, the first run of Giveme5W1H after you started the CoreNLP Server, will likely take a couple of minutes (because components in CoreNLP Server are initialized on the fly). So, be sure to start the server and use it to extract 5W1Hs from multiple news articles, or - even better - have the CoreNLP Server run permanently. See [below](#corenlp-host) if you want to use a CoreNLP Server that is running on a remote machine or different port.

## Configuration
The following configurations are optional.

### CoreNLP Host
You can also use a remotely installed  CoreNLP-Server. Simply parse the preprocessor another URL in case you run it on another machine:

```python
from Giveme5W1H.extractor.preprocessors.preprocessor_core_nlp import Preprocessor

preprocessor = Preprocessor('192.168.178.10:9000')
MasterExtractor(preprocessor=preprocessor)
```

### Output
- For file-based data - every input is transferred to the output
    -  For instance, annotated is already a part of the provided example files
- Each Question has their extracted candidates under extracted,
- Each Candidate, has parts, score and text property and their sentence index.
- Each part is structured as (payload, Postoken)
- Each payload has at least nlpToken which is the "basic" information.
- Each enhancer is saving his information under their name in the payload

See the [sample.json](https://github.com/fhamborg/Giveme5W1H/blob/master/misc/sample.json) for details.

## Processing-Files
Giveme5W can read and write only in a JSON format [example](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please/blob/master/newsplease/examples/sample.json).
[You find ready to use examples here](/examples/extracting)

> dID is used for matching input and output, not the filename!

There is an easy-to-use handler to work with files; these are all options::
```python
 documents = (
        # initiate the file handler with the input directory
        Handler(inputPath)
            # add giveme5w extractor  (it would only copying files without...)
            .set_extractor(extractor)

            # Optional: set a output directory
            .set_output_path(outputPath)

            # Optional: set a path to cache and load preprocessed documents (CoreNLP & Enhancer results)
            .set_preprocessed_path(preprocessedPath)

            # Optional: limit the documents read from the input directory (handy for development)
            .set_limit(1)

            # Optional: resume ability, skip input file if its already in output
            .skip_documents_with_output()

            # load and saves all document runtime objects for further programming
            .preload_and_cache_documents()

            ## setup is done: executing it
            .process()

            # get the processed documents, this can only be done because preload_and_cache_documents was called
            .get_documents()
    )
```
Check the examples under parse_documents_simple.py and parse_documents.py for more details


### Caching
CoreNLP and Enhancer have a long execution time; therefore it is possible to cache the result at the filesystem to speed up multiple executions.
Delete all files in "/cache", if you want to process them again, see examples in 'examples/extracting' for more details.

> if you add or remove enhancer, you must delete all files in the cache directory (if caching is enabled (set_preprocessed_path))


## Learn_Weights
/examples/misc/Learn_Weights.py is running the extractor with different weights from 0-10.
The best candidate is compared with the best annotation to get a score.
The calculated score, document id, and the used weights are saved per question under ./results.

> Because of the combined_scorer, each document is evaluated in each step. This can lead to entries with the same weights, but with different scores.
