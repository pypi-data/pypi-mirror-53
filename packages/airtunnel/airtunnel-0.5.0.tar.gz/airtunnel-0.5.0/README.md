# airtunnel
Airtunnel is a means of supplementing [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), a platform for workflow
automation in Python which is angled at analytics/data pipelining. It was born out of years of project experience in
data science, and the hardships of running large data platforms in real life businesses. Hence, Airtunnel is both a
set of principles (read more on them [in the official airtunnel announcement](https://medium.com)) and a lightweight
Python library *to tame your airflow*!
