    r"""A single-task exact GP model.

    A single-task exact GP using relatively strong priors on the Kernel
    hyperparameters, which work best when covariates are normalized to the unit
    cube and outcomes are standardized (zero mean, unit variance).

    This model works in batch mode (each batch having its own hyperparameters).
    When the training observations include multiple outputs, this model will use
    batching to model outputs independently.

    Use this model when you have independent output(s) and all outputs use the same
    training data. If outputs are independent and outputs have different training
    data, use the ModelListGP. When modeling correlations between outputs, use
    the MultiTaskGP.
