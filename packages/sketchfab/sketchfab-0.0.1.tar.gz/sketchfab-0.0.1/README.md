# Sketchfab API Client

## Why
- Couldn't find a sketchfab API client
- The sample code from sketchfab websites are pretty much unuseable (for many reasons)

## Choices
- The API is designed to be as simple as possible to use
- Only the required features will be implemented
- Anyone can ask for features
