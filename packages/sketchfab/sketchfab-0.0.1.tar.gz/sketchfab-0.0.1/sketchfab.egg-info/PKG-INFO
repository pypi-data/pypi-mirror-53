Description: # Sketchfab API Client
        
        ## Why
        - Couldn't find a sketchfab API client
        - The sample code from sketchfab websites are pretty much unuseable (for many reasons)
        
        ## Choices
        - The API is designed to be as simple as possible to use
        - Only the required features will be implemented
        - Anyone can ask for features
