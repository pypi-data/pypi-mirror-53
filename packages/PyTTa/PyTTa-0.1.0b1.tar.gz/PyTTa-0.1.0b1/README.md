## PyTTa - Python in Technical Acoustics

The project began as an effort to create audio, acoustics and vibrational data acquiring and analysis toolbox to a free cost level, high end results, combining the passion for programming with the expertise in acoustics and vibration of the Acoustics Engineers from the Federal University of Santa Maria.

We are students, teachers, engineers, passionates and inquiring people, on the first steps of a journey throughout the Python path to bring Acoustics to the Open Seas, Open Sources and Open World!

### Usage

We extrongly recommend using Anaconda Python Distribution, as it integrates an IDE (Spyder) and lots of packages over which PyTTa is based on
as Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and PyPI (pip) which is used to install Sounddevice, PyFilterbank and PyTTa itself

### Documentation

This package aims to be an easy interface between acoustician and vibrational engineers in the use of Python for study, engineering or any other ends that it may suite.
From import to each function and attribute we wrote a little documentation that may be useful for understanding everything available, and what is just a mean to an end.

To begin, one can try:

    >>> import pytta
    >>> pytta.list_devices()
    >>> pytta.Default()

This set of commands will print the available audio I/O devices and the default parameters as they are on the Default class object

To read everything available on the package, and assuming the use of Spyder IDE, one can press "ctrl+i" with the cursor in front of the module, submodule, class, methods, or function names,
this will open the help menu with the documentation of the respective item.
    
    >>> pytta|
    >>> pytta.properties|
    >>> pytta.generate|
    >>> pytta.functions|
    >>> pytta.classes|

The | represents the cursor position to press "ctrl+i" in order to use the Spyder help widget.

Inside each submodule the user will find instructions on the available tools, and how to access them.

### Dependencies

- Numpy;
- Scipy;
- Matplotlib;
- Sounddevice;
- PyFilterbank.

### Installation

For now, the installation must be made through pip and git, as follows:

    >>> pip install git+https://www.github.com/pyttamaster/pytta

This will install directly the refactory branch, which is the most stable branch on the repository

### Contributing and Credits

Our workflow, which may change as we progress with the project, consist on parallel development of submodules, either complementing an existing one, or creating a new.
Thus, one must create a new branch, named accordingly with the project intent, and that points to the refactory OR the development branches, as they are intended to merge in the near future.
After the new branch is ready and coding finished, it stays as a branch for, at maximum, two months untill it is merged to the development branch.
