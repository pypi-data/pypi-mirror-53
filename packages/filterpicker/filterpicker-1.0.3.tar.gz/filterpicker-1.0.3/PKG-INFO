        FilterPicker is a general purpose, broad-band, phase detector and picker which is applicable to real-time seismic monitoring and earthquake early-warning.
        This module is a Python implementation of the A.Lomax Filter Picker. Inspiration has been taken from the MATLAB [implementation](https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69211-filterpicker-a-robust-broadband-phase-detector-and-picker)[3] of Y.Kamer. This picker class has been rewritten using NumPy libraries.

        ## Installation
        
        
        Recently the package has been uploaded in _PyPi_ repository, therefore you could just type:
        ```
        pip install filterpicker
        ```
        and be ready to go.
        
        If you want to install the library manually or just being updated to the latest patches, the installation is pretty easy because the package comes with an installer. All the dependencies are explained in the `requirements.txt` file. It's suggested to use a virtual environment (`conda` or `pipenv`)
        
        Just open a terminal and type
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/billy4all/filterpicker /somwhere/in/my/pc
        $ cd where/you/cloned
        $ # optionally activate your virtual env
        $ pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Tests
        To run a simple test to make sure you're ready to go, just type:
        ```
        $ cd where/the/package/is
        $ pytest
        ```
        
        You can also double check the performance of the software by running the scripts in the `example` folder (manual installation) or run the command-line exec store `obspy_script` (PyPI).
        The module is fully compatible with the famous **ObsPy** library: just fed the picker with the trace data (`obspy.core.Trace.data` numpy array).
