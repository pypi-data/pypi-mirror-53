Description: # Comp-Lead [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/comp-lead?color=blue)](https://pypi.org/project/comp-lead/)
        
        This is my first PyPI package, so this is very simple. This package displays a handful of tech leaders and companies (five to be exact).
        The reason why I decided to create this package was to just understand the way packages are built and how they are published.
        
        ### Usage:

        ```sh
        pip install comp-lead
