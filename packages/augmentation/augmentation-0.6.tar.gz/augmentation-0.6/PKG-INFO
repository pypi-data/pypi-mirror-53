Description: # GPU accelerated data augmentation
        
        This code provides standard augmentation strategies on the GPU, as some of these can be intensive on the CPU. Our GPU translation is based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The current version supports both 2D and 3D data augmentation.
