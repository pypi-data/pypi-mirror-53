        ## Description
        
        This is my attempt to implement the AES encryption algorithm in Python 3.7.
        
        This is my first real project that has taken a while to study and understand the mathematics behind the scenes in how it operates and also my first project uploaded to Github so that I can learn how to properly use version control software as well.
        
        
        
        End goal is to be used in the creation of a password manager system.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Package can be installed with pip via:
        
        pip install ech2901-pyaes
        
        ## Simple Use Case
        from pyaes.AES import ECB
        
        ecb_mode = ECB()
        
        ciphertext, salt = ecb_mode.encrypt(b'test', b'password')
        
        plaintext = ecb_mode.decrypt(ciphertext, b'password', salt=salt)
