        <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
        ## About The Project
        
        Generating regex can sometimes be complicated. That is why we are introducing this package to help you get things done.
        
        Supported functionalities : 
        - Regex Generation for Numerical Range
        
        ### What does each functionalities do?
        
        __1. Regex Generation for Numerical Range__   
        
        Generate regex given a numerical range, So when given a new number between this range the regex will match.
        
        _Person who has motivated me to start this repository is listed in the acknowledgments._
        
        ### Coded With Language
        * [Python 3.6](https://python.org)
        
        
        
        <!-- GETTING STARTED -->
        ## Getting Started
        
        Simply install the package, import it in your python code and run the method needed.
        Look at the docstring or source code to understand what is happening. 
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Python 3.6 or greater
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```sh
        pip install regex-engine
        ```
        
        
        <!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
        ## Usage
        
        ### 1. Regex Generation for Numerical Range
        
        __You get what you give :__ If given numbers are integers you get a regex that will only match with integer and if floating-point numbers are given it only match with floating-point number.
        
        Supports integer and floating-point numbers. It can even be a negative range.
        
        ```python
        from regex_engine import generator
        generate = generator()
        regex1 = generate.numerical_range(5,89)
        regex2 = generate.numerical_range(81.78,250.23)
        regex3 = generate.numerical_range(-65,12)
        ```
        Example regex generated for 25-53
        ```
        ^([3-4][0-9]|2[5-9]|5[0-3])$
        ```
        
        The regex might not be optimal but it will surely serve the purpose.
        
        The problem of checking a number is within a range might have been simple if you didn't choose the regex path.   
        `if a <= your_input_number <=b` would have simply solved the same problem.
        
        We dedicate this method in the package to the people who are pursuing a different path or thinking out of the box.
