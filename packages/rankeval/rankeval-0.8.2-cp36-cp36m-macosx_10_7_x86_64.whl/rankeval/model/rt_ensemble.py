        Load the model from the file identified by file_path using the given
        format.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path : str
            The fpath to the filename where the model has been saved
        name : str

            The format of the model to load.
        base_score : None or float
            The initial prediction score of all instances, global bias.
            If None, it uses default value used by each software
            (0.5 XGBoost, 0.0 all the others).
        learning_rate : None or float
            The learning rate used by the model to shrinks the contribution of
             each tree. By default it is set to 1 (no shrinking at all).
        n_trees : None or int
            The maximum number of trees to load from the model. By default it is
            set to None, meaning the method will load all the trees.

            The path to the filename where the model has been saved

        trees_root: list of integers
            Numpy array modelling the indexes of the root nodes of the regression trees composing the ensemble. The indexes
            refer to the following data structures:
            * trees_left_child
            * trees_right_child
            * trees_nodes_value
            * trees_nodes_feature
        trees_weight: list of floats
            Numpy array modelling the weights of the regression trees composing the ensemble.
        trees_left_child: list of integers
            Numpy array modelling the structure (shape) of the regression trees, considering only the left children.
            Given a node of a regression tree (a single cell in this array), the value identify the index of the left
            children. If the node is a leaf, the children assumes -1 value.
        trees_right_child: list of integers
            Numpy array modelling the structure (shape) of the regression trees, considering only the right children.
            Given a node of a regression tree (a single cell in this array), the value identify the index of the right
            children. If the node is a leaf, the children assumes -1 value.
        trees_nodes_value: list of integers
            Numpy array modelling either the output of a leaf node (whether the node is a leaf, in accordance with the
            trees_structure data structure) or the splitting value of the node in the regression trees (with respect to the
            feature identified by the trees_nodes_feature data structure).
        trees_nodes_feature: list of integers
