Installation
============

-  You can install this package using

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyresparser

-  For NLP operations we use spacy and nltk. Install them using below
   commands:

.. code:: bash

    # spaCy
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

    # nltk
    python -m nltk.downloader words

Supported File Formats
======================

-  PDF and DOCx files are supported on all Operating Systems
-  If you want to extract DOC files you can install
   `textract <https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`__
   for your OS (Linux, MacOS)
-  Note: You just have to install textract (and nothing else) and doc
   files will get parsed easily

CLI
===

For running the resume extractor you can also use the ``cli`` provided

.. code:: bash

    usage: pyresparser [-h] [-f FILE] [-d DIRECTORY]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help                              show this help message and exit
      -f FILE, --file FILE                    resume file to be extracted
      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY     directory containing all the resumes to be extracted
      -r REMOTEFILE, --remotefile REMOTEFILE  remote path for resume file to be extracted

For extracting data from a single resume file, use

.. code:: bash

    pyresparser -f <resume_file_path>

For extracting data from several resumes, place them in a directory and
then execute

.. code:: bash

    pyresparser -d <resume_directory_path>

For extracting data from remote resumes, execute

.. code:: bash

    pyresparser -r <path_to_remote_resume_file>

Notes:
======

-  If you are running the app on windows, then you can only extract
   .docs and .pdf files

The module would return a list of dictionary objects with result as
follows:
