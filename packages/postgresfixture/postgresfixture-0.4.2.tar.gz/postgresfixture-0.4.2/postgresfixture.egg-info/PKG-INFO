        A Python fixture for creating PostgreSQL clusters and databases, and
        tearing them down again, intended for use during development and
        testing.

        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Use like any other fixture::
        
          from contextlib import closing
          from postgresfixture import ClusterFixture
        
          def test_something(self):
              cluster = self.useFixture(ClusterFixture("db"))
              cluster.createdb("example")
              with closing(cluster.connect("example")) as conn:
                  ...
              cluster.dropbdb("example")  # Optional.
        
        This will create a new cluster, create a database called "example",
        then tear it all down at the end; nothing will remain on disk. If you
        want the cluster and its databases to remain on disk, pass
        ``preserve=True`` to the ``ClusterFixture`` constructor.
        
        
        From the command line
        =====================
        
        Once this package is installed, you'll have a ``postgresfixture``
        script. Alternatively you can use ``python -m postgresfixture`` to
        achieve the same thing. Use ``--help`` to discover the options
        available to you.
