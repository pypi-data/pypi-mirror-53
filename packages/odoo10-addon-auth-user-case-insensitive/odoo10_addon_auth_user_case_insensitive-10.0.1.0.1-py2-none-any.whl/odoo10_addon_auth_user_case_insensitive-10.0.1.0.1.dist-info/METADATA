=======================
Case Insensitive Logins
=======================

This module makes user logins case insensitive. It also overwrites the
search method to allow these case insensitive logins to work on a database
that previously had case sensitive logins.

Installation
============

Install this module as you would any other. No further configuration is
required.

Note that upon installation the existing logins will all be converted to lowercase.


Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed feedback.
