        Kudubot is a chat bot framework designed to work with arbitrary messaging
        services based on
        [bokkichat](https://gitlab.namibsun.net/namibsun/python/bokkichat)
        connections.
        
        # Installation
        
        Installing bokkichat is as simple as running ```pip install kudubot```, or
        ```python setup.py install``` when installing from source.
        
        # Implementing a kudubot
        
        To implement a kudubot, you'll need to create a class that inherits from
        ```kudubot.Bot.Bot``` and implement the various on_X methods in the way
        you want the bot to react.
        
        Kudubot is meant to react on commands like ```/send 123```. Those are
        modelled using CommandParser and Command objects. Those are used to
        automatically parse incoming text messages and are sent to ```on_command```,
        which delegates them to ```on_<command name>``` methods by default.
        
        If you want complete manual control over what happens with incoming messages,
        override the ```on_msg``` method. If you only care about text messages, do the
        same for ```on_text```.
        
        To get an idea of how to implement a kudubot, have a look at some of these
        sample projects:

        * [securiphant](https://gitlab.namibsun.net/namibsun/python/securiphant)
