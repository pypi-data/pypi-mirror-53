Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The `ox\ :sub:`update` <https://github.com/emin63/ox_update>`__ package
        provides some tools to keep your machine up to date.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install via the usual ``pip install ox_update``. If you want to
        install and be able to edit your installation, you may consider doing
        something like ``pip install --editable ox_update``.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can see the list of possible commands via
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_update check --help
        
        One of the most useful commands is ``ox_update check``. This will check
        your Ubuntu installation to see if you have the latest security updates
        installed. If you do, then nothing happens. If you have not done
        ``apt update`` recently or you do **NOT** have the latest packages
        installed, then you will be notified.
        
        You can control the notification methods and how many days have passed
        since you did ``apt update`` using command line options. For example,
        doing
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_update check --notifiers echo --age-in-days 7
        
        would not notify you provided that you have done ``apt update`` within 7
        days. If your packages are stale, the notification will just print a
        message. See the `Notifiers section <id:sec-notifiers>`__ for
        notification options.
        
        Notifiers
        ---------
        
        There are a variety of ways to get notifications:
        
        -  ``echo``: Just echoes notification to stdout.
        -  ``email``: Will send you an email provided you specify the following:
        
           -  ``OX_UPDATE_EMAIL_TO``: A comma separated list of email addresses
              (e.g., ``foo@exmaple.com`` or ``foo@exmaple.com,bar@example.com``)
              to send email to. If not set, will attempt to lookup from
              environment variable.
           -  ``OX_UPDATE_EMAIL_FROM``: Sending email address. If not set, will
              attempt to lookup from environment variable.
           -  ``OX_UPDATE_GMAIL_PASSWD``: A password to use if you want to use
              gmail as the SMTP relay to send mail from. This password should
              correspond to the username in ``OX_UPDATE_EMAIL_FROM``.
           -  ``OX_UPDATE_SES_PROFILE``: If provided and email notifier is
              requested, will use this to send email via AWS SES. If not set,
              will attempt lookup from environment.
           -  **IMPORTANT**: Either ``OX_UPDATE_SES_PROFILE`` or
              ``OX_UPDATE_GMAIL_PASSWD`` is required to send emails.
        
        -  ``loginfo``: Will use Python's ``logging.info`` to send notification.
           This can be useful if you do not want the notifications in stdout but
           in stderr.
