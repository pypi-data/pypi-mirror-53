        # 4bars by Abletonists
        In Ableton Live, automatically record 4 bar sequences. Multi-scene record, then export all new recordings, name them, catalogue them.
        
        ## Ableton Workflow as Code
        - inject several midi tracks (as code)
        - setup devices (as code)
        - configure devices (program, controls)
        - apply envelopes to clips
        - export as 4 bars audio
        - use track+clip+RandomName+index naming conventions and output files to destination folder
        - (optional) submit 4 bar sequences to 4bars.media for social sequencing
        
        ## Requirements
