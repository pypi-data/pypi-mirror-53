----------------------------------------

## ToDo

  - update download_performers and seperate randomizing selection

### Low Priority
  - add: read messages html for emojis
  - finalize / fix: script exit
  - add: Twitter (social media reminders)
  - update: backup function to include original folder name -> posted/galleries/$file
  - add: feature for if missing scene previews to capture thumbnail from content/trailer
  - add: easier way to select local file to upload

### Medium Priority
  - add: login prompt for saving Twitter password -> base64 hash instead of in config.json
  |_ add: `Auth` option to settings?
  - add: `local` setting

  - update: data.txt for scenes with trailer
  - update: scene to include trailer
  - update: upload trailer same time as previews instead of content

  - add email functionality for sending trial link; add clipboard function to copy link

### High Priority
  - prepare: a scene for release
  |_ requires: scene cron feature

  - rewrite scene release to NOT upload until releaseDate days after
  -- requires daily check or cron job

  - test: performers upload w/ change to images/videos preferences

  - add: same change to other folder download preferences
  |_ ? which change
  - add: scene feature to check data.txts for content to release n days after trailer/preview
  |_ requires: cron feature
  - add: cron feature for installing crons
  |_ all it has to do is write to the crontab file

Performers mostly advertise on Twitter
- so add a feature that routinely tweets defined reminders
- text that is tweeted
- any links to include (counts against text limit)
- must support emojis
- must not spam, must follow a schedule. monthly, weekly on a day, daily at an hour
- maybe delete previous tweets?
- maybe tweet once and pin it?

General Solutions:
- needs to solve fanbase interaction for someone like me who really doesn't get it get it
  - it should ask fans what more of they want to see
    - add: ability to post polls
  - it should message fans individually more of what they want to see
    - add: ask all new users their preferences; run once for existing users
- it should backup sent message/images differently than the current posted folder -> why?
- it should ask users what they like and then build its own profile and then message that user approrpiately -> "do you like dick pics or ass pics?" -> n days later -> here's a dick pic just for you ;)"

-> Cron that checks user messages for bot commands
 - post: "OnlySnarf Bot commands: !pic | !pic dick | !pic ass"
-- sends [pic] to [user]
