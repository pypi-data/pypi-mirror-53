======================================

This repository contains PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations of the
quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) and quasi-hyperbolic Adam (QHAdam)
optimization algorithms from Facebook AI Research.

Reference
=========

QHM and QHAdam were proposed in the ICLR 2019 paper
`"Quasi-hyperbolic momentum and Adam for deep learning"`__. We recommend
reading the paper for both theoretical insights into and empirical analyses of
the algorithms.
