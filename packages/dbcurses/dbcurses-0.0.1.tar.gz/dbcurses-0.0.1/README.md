# dbcurses

This application has been realized mainly inspired by sqlcrush (https://github.com/coffeeandscripts/sqlcrush). 
The reason why I decided to create my own version of the application is the need to comfortably display the data in the MySQL database (in a SSH connection) without manually performing SELECTs, and I wasn't able to do so with sqlcrush (the project no longer seems to be maintained). Another reason is that there is no need to install postgresql. 

However, this project has far less functionality than sqlcrush for the time being and is only used to display data in the database. **Actually, only MySQL is supported.**
