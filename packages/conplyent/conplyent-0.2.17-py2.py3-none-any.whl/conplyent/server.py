    Begins the server on the current process. This is a looped call and only
    exists on KeyboardInterrupt  or if a connected client has requested to close
    the server.

    This is a wrapper aorund the ZMQ library using the PAIR method to
    communicate with the client. This binds the socket to localhost and port
    specified and will continually listen to the port for any activity.
    Initially, the client should begin by establishing the connection and
    performing a handshake to ensure that server is alive. This is done within
    the ZMQPair class and this method doesn't need to worry about it.

    Once the connection has been established, this method will continually
    listen for any requests from the client. Requests available are broken into
    three categories: heartbeat, sync, and command. Heartbeat, also handled
    within ZMQPair, simply responds back to the client to let the client know
    that the server is alive and able to communicate. Sync lets the client know
    which commands are registered and able for client to run (more on this
    later). Commands allows the client to access any registered method which
    the server can begin executing. When the server receives a command, it will
    immediately respond with an acknowledge to let the client know that the
    message has been received. Then, will continue executing the command. These
    commands can be foreground or background commands. Many commands can be
    performed in the foreground if they are not IO bound. For background tasks,
    server will update the client letting them know what job number has been
    assigned to this task so the client can receive messages and sort them out.
    There are also registered methods that can interact with the background
    tasks to affect their runtime.

    Finally, for the pre-defined registered method of "close_server", the server
    will update the client as per the method definition and then gracefully
    exit.

    Decorator that registers the underlying function as a registered
    command that clients can execute remotely. This registration is used by the
    server to determine available commands.

    The wrapper will initially update the client and echo the request. Then,
    will execute the method and retrive the exit code. If there was an exception
    from the function, the wrapper will inform the client of the error and
    update the exit code to ERROR (1). Finally, the wrapper will report the
    completion of the function to the client reporting the exit code
    (INVALID_PARAMETER = -1, SUCCESS = 0, ERROR = 1).

    This module defines several commands that are available by default. Users
    can develop their own custom server commands using this decorator or even
    choose to clear default commands by clearing MSG_PORT if they so wish.

    By default this will provide the commands as accessible by their function
    name but am considering possibly allowing users to specify a name. (simple
    but need to create a few asserts to ensure it's a valid name <<).

    The functions that are registered under the server require that the first
    argument be idx. Idx refers to the job number that will be assigned once
    the function is called. This is important in updating the client to
    ensure that we are able to communicate to the client with the proper job
    number.

    From within the function, users can use calls to
    :meth:`server.update_client` to update the client with any output.

    .. note:: These functions will not include the idx in their docstring cuz
        it would be super redundant and don't help in their explanation

    Decorator that registers the underlying function as a registered
    command that clients can execute remotely. This function will be executed on
    a background thread with a python Queue established between the main thread
    and the background thread for communication. These background commands are
    useful for functions that are IO bound or for those that will take longer
    than a few instructions (to prevent the server from blocking). Finally,
    these threads are ran as 'daemon' so exits alongside the server if the
    server prematurely exits.

    These background commands follow similar wrapper pattern to
    :meth:`server.register_command` in their exit code and error handling. These
    functions must return an exit code but do not need to worry about pre- and
    post- handling. Unlike the regular register_command decorator, this wrapper
    will add the command call to the JOBS dictionary as an active job which
    can be used for communcation using other commands.

    The function must have idx, and queue as their first two arguments.
    See register_command for details on idx, and how to update the client with
    output. Queue is used to communicate between the main server thread and
    these background threads if they require such communication. I.e. if we want
    to implement commands that require the thread's response. For default
    commands provided by conplyent, the queue and thread objects can be accessed
    through JOBS dict. This dict is accessible by providing job number as key
    and a tuple using QUEUE_IDX and THREAD_IDX to access the queue and thread
    objects respectively. The default queue recognition is by providing a
    dictionary that specifies "type" as either INPUT or KILL, and "value" if
    necessary. If developers chooses to create their own functions, they can
    redefine this queue as they see fit.
