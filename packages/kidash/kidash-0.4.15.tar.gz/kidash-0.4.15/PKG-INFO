Description: # Kidash
        
        Kidash is a prototype of a tool for managing Kibana dashboards from the command line. It is a part of [GrimoireLab](https://grimoirelab.github.io).
        
        ## Usage
        
        Get a list of all options with:
        
        ```
        $ kidash.py --help
        ```
        
        For the names of the files containing panels definitions (JSON panel files),
        kidash supports both importing them from local directories, of from the
        `grimoirelab-panels` Python package, if installed. In fact, that package is
        a dependency of kidash, which means that if you installed via pip, it will
        always be present.
        
        The algorith for finding a JSON panel file is, roughly:
        
        * If the specified path (such as `panels/json/git.json` or `git.json`)
        is found relative to the local directory, use it.
        * If not found, if the specified path starts with `panels/json/`,
        remove that part and look for the panel file in the `grimoirelab-panels`
        package.
        * If not found, look for the specified path directly in the
        `grimoirelab-panels` package.
        
        For example:
        
        ```
        $ kidash.py --elastic_url-enrich http://localhost:9200 \
          --import git.json
        ```
        
        will look for a file `git.json` in the current directory,
        and if not found, for `git.json` in the `grimoirelab-panels` Python package,
        if installed.
