# ******************************************  OutputState *****************************************************

"""

Overview
--------

OutputState(s) represent the result(s) of executing a Mechanism.  This may be the result(s) of its
`function <OutputState.function>` and/or values derived from that result.  The full set of results are stored in the
Mechanism's `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute.  OutputStates are used to represent
individual items of the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>`, and/or useful quantities derived from
them.  For example, the `function <TransferMechanism.TransferMechanism.function>` of a `TransferMechanism` generates
a single result (the transformed value of its input);  however, a TransferMechanism can also be assigned OutputStates
that represent its mean, variance or other derived values.  In contrast, the `function <DDM.DDM.function>`
of a `DDM` Mechanism generates several results (such as decision accuracy and response time), each of which can be
assigned as the `value <OutputState.value>` of a different OutputState.  The OutputState(s) of a Mechanism can serve
as the input to other  Mechanisms (by way of `projections <Projections>`), or as the output of a Process and/or
System.  The OutputState's `efferents <OutputState.efferents>` attribute lists all of its outgoing
projections.

.. _OutputStates_Creation:

Creating an OutputState
-----------------------

An OutputState can be created by calling its constructor. However, in general this is not necessary, as a Mechanism
automatically creates a default OutputState if none is explicitly specified, that contains the primary result of its
`function <Mechanism_Base.function>`.  For example, if the Mechanism is created within the `pathway` of a
`Process <Process>`, an OutputState is created and assigned as the `sender <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.sender>`
of a `MappingProjection` to the next Mechanism in the pathway, or to the Process' `output <Process_Input_And_Output>`
if the Mechanism is a `TERMINAL` Mechanism for that Process. Other configurations can also easily be specified using
a Mechanism's **output_states** argument (see `OutputState_Specification` below).  If it is created using its
constructor, and a Mechanism is specified in the **owner** argument, it is automatically assigned to that Mechanism.
If its **owner* is not specified, `initialization is deferred.

.. _OutputState_Deferred_Initialization:

*Owner Assignment and Deferred Initialization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An OutputState must be owned by a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`.  When OutputState is specified in the constructor for a
`Mechanism <Mechanism>` (see `below <InputState_Specification>`), it is automatically assigned to that Mechanism as
its owner. If the OutputState is created directly, its `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism can specified in the
**owner** argument of its constructor, in which case it is assigned to the specified Mechanism.  Otherwise, its
initialization is `deferred <State_Deferred_Initialization>` until
COMMENT:
TBI: its `owner <State_Base.owner>` attribute is assigned or
COMMENT
the OutputState is assigned to a Mechanism using the Mechanism's `add_states <Mechanism_Base.add_states>` method.

.. _OutputState_Primary:

*Primary OutputState*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every Mechanism has at least one OutputState, referred to as its *primary OutputState*.  If OutputStates are not
`explicitly specified <OutputState_Specification>` for a Mechanism, a primary OutputState is automatically created
and assigned to its `output_state <Mechanism_Base.output_state>` attribute (note the singular),
and also to the first entry of the Mechanism's `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute
(note the plural).  The primary OutputState is assigned an `index <OutputState.index>` of '0', and therefore its
`value <OutputState.value>` is assigned as the first (and often only) item of the Mechanism's `value
<Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute.

.. _OutputState_Specification:

*OutputState Specification*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifying OutputStates when a Mechanism is created
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OutputStates can be specified for a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` when it is created, in the **output_states** argument of the
Mechanism's constructor (see `examples <State_Constructor_Argument_Examples>` in State), or in an *OUTPUT_STATES* entry
of a parameter dictionary assigned to the constructor's **params** argument.  The latter takes precedence over the
former (that is, if an *OUTPUT_STATES* entry is included in the parameter dictionary, any specified in the
**output_states** argument are ignored).

    .. _OutputState_Replace_Default_Note:

    .. note::
        Assigning OutputStates to a Mechanism in its constructor **replaces** any that are automatically generated for
        that Mechanism (i.e., those that it creates for itself by default).  If any of those need to be retained, they
        must be explicitly specified in the list assigned to the **output_states** argument or the *OUTPUT_STATES* entry
        of the parameter dictionary in the **params** argument).  In particular, if the default OutputState -- that
        usually contains the result of the Mechanism's `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` -- is to be retained,
        it too must be specified along with any additional OutputStates desired.


Adding OutputStates to a Mechanism after it is created
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OutputStates can also be added to a Mechanism, using the Mechanism's `add_states <Mechanism_Base.add_methods>` method.
Unlike specification in the constructor, this **does not** replace any OutputStates already assigned to the Mechanism.
Doing so appends them to the list of OutputStates in the Mechanism's `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>`
attribute, and their values are appended to its `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute.  If the name
of an OutputState added to a Mechanism is the same as one that is already exists on the Mechanism, its name is suffixed
with a numerical index (incremented for each OutputState with that name; see `Naming`), and the OutputState is added
to the list (that is, it does *not* replace the one that was already there).


.. _OutputState_Variable_and_Value:

*OutputStates* `variable <OutputState.variable>` *and* `value <OutputState.value>`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each OutputState created with or assigned to a Mechanism must reference one or more items of the Mechanism's attributes,
that serve as the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`, and are used by its `function <OutputState.function>`
to generate the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`.  By default, it uses the first item of its `owner
<OutputState.owner>` Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>`.  However, other attributes (or combinations of them)
can be specified in the **variable** argument of the OutputState's constructor, or the *VARIABLE* entry in an
`OutputState specification dictionary <OutputState_Specification_Dictionary>` (see `OutputState_Customization`).
The specification must be compatible (in the number and type of items it generates) with the input expected by the
OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`. The OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` is used as the
input to its `function <OutputState.function>` to generate the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`, possibly
modulated by a `GatingSignal` (see `below <OutputState_Modulatory_Projections>`).  The OutputState's `value
<OutputState.value>` must, in turn, be compatible with any Projections that are assigned to it, or `used to specify
it <OutputState_Projection_Destination_Specification>`.

The `value <OutputState.value>` of each OutputState of a Mechanism is assigned to a corresponding item of the
Mechanism's `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute, in the order in which they are assigned in
the **output_states** argument of its constructor, and listed in its `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>`
attribute.

    .. note::
       The `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute of a Mechanism is **not the same** as its `value
       <Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute:
           * a Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.value>` attribute contains the full and unmodified results of its
             `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`;
           * a Mechanism's `output_values <Mechanism.output_values>` attribute contains a list of the `value
             <OutputState.value>` of each of its OutputStates.

.. _OutputState_Forms_of_Specification:

Forms of Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OutputStates can be specified in a variety of ways, that fall into three broad categories:  specifying an OutputState
directly; use of a `State specification dictionary <State_Specification>`; or by specifying one or more Components to
which it should project. Each of these is described below:

    .. _OutputState_Direct_Specification:

    **Direct Specification of an OutputState**

    * existing **OutputState object** or the name of one -- it cannot belong to another Mechanism, and the format of
      its `variable <OutputState.variable>` must be compatible with the aributes of the `owner <OutputState.owner>`
      Mechanism specified for the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` (see `OutputState_Customization`).
    ..
    * **OutputState class**, **keyword** *OUTPUT_STATE*, or a **string** -- creates a default OutputState that uses
      the first item of the `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` as its `variable
      <OutputState.variable>`, and assigns it as the `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism's `primary OutputState
      <OutputState_Primary>`. If the class name or *OUTPUT_STATE* keyword is used, a default name is assigned to the
      State; if a string is specified, it is used as the `name <OutputState.name>` of the OutputState  (see `Naming`).

    .. _OutputState_Specification_by_Variable:

    * **variable** -- creates an OutputState using the specification as the OutputState's `variable
      <OutputState.variable>` (see `OutputState_Customization`).  This must be compatible with (have the same number
      and type of elements as) the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.  A default name is assigned based
      on the name of the Mechanism (see `Naming`).
    ..
    .. _OutputState_Specification_Dictionary:

    **OutputState Specification Dictionary**

    * **OutputState specification dictionary** -- this can be used to specify the attributes of an OutputState,
      using any of the entries that can be included in a `State specification dictionary <State_Specification>`
      (see `examples <State_Specification_Dictionary_Examples>` in State), including:

      * *VARIABLE*:<keyword or list> - specifies the attribute(s) of its `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism to use
        as the input to the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>` (see `OutputState_Customization`); this
        must be compatible (in the number and format of the items it specifies) with the OutputState's `function
        <OutputState.function>`.

      * *FUNCTION*:<`Function <Function>`, function or method> - specifies the function used to transform and/or
        combine the item(s) specified for the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` into its
        `value <OutputState.value>`;  its input must be compatible (in the number and format of elements) with the
        specification of the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` (see `OutputState_Customization`).

      * *PROJECTIONS* or *MECHANISMS*:<list of `Projections <Projection>` and/or `Mechanisms <Mechanism>`> - specifies
        one or more efferent `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` from the OutputState, Mechanims that should
        receive them, and/or `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` for it to receive;  this may be constrained
        by or have consequences for the OutputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` and/or its `value
        <OutputState.value>` (see `OutputState_Compatibility_and_Constraints`).

        .. note::
           The *INDEX* and *ASSIGN* attributes described below have been deprecated in version 0.4.5, and should be
           replaced by use of the *VARIABLE* and *FUNCTION* entries, respectively.  Although use of *INDEX* and *ASSIGN*
           is currently being supported for backward compatibility, this may be eliminated in a future version.

      * *INDEX*:<int> *[DEPRECATED in version 0.4.5]* - specifies the item of the `owner <OutputState.owner>`
        Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` to be used for the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`;
        equivalent to specifying (OWNER_VALUE, <int>) for *VARIABLE* (see `OutputState_Customization`), which should be
        used for compatibility with future versions.

      * *ASSIGN*:<function> *[DEPRECATED in version 0.4.5]* - specifies the OutputState's `function`
        <OutputState.assign>` attribute;  *FUNCTION* should be used for compatibility with future versions.

    ?? PUT IN ITS OWN SECTION ABOVE OR BELOW??
    Projections from an OutputState can be specified either as attributes, in the constructor for an OutputState (in
    its **projections** argument or in the *PROJECTIONS* entry of an `OutputState specification dictionary
    <OutputState_Specification_Dictionary>`), or used to specify the OutputState itself (using one of the
    `OutputState_Forms_of_Specification` described above. See `State Projections <State_Projections>` for additional
    details concerning the specification of Projections when creating a State.

    .. _OutputState_Projections:

    *Projections*
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    When an OutputState is created, it can be assigned one or more `Projections <Projection>`, using either the
    **projections** argument of its constructor, or in an entry of a dictionary assigned to the **params** argument with
    the key *PROJECTIONS*.  An OutputState can be assigned either `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` or
    `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>`.  MappingProjections are assigned to its `efferents <OutputState.efferents>`
    attribute and GatingProjections to its `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.  See
    `State Projections <State_Projections>` for additional details concerning the specification of Projections when
    creating a State.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    COMMENT

    An OutputState can also be specified by specifying one or more Components to or from which it should be assigned
    Projection(s). Specifying an OutputState in this way creates both the OutputState and any of the specified or
    implied Projection(s) (if they don't already exist). `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`
    are assigned to the OutputState's `efferents <OutputState.efferents>` attribute, and `GatingProjections
    <GatingProjection>` to its `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>` attribute. Any of the following can be used
    to specify an InputState by the Components that projection to it (see `below
    <OutputState_Compatability_and_Constraints>` for an explanation of the relationship between the `variable` of these
    Components and the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`):

    * **InputState, GatingSignal, Mechanism, or list with any of these** -- creates an OutputState with
      the relevant Projection(s).  A `MappingProjection` is created to each InputState or ProcessingMechanism specified
      (for a Mechanism, its `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` is used). A `GatingProjection` is created for
      each GatingSignal or GatingMechamism specified (for a GatingMechanism, its first GatingSignal is used).
    ..
    * **Projection** -- any form of `Projection specification <Projection_Specification>` can be used; creates an
      OutputState and assigns it as the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` for any MappingProjections specified, and
      as the `receiver <GatingProjection.receiver>` for any GatingProjections specified.

    .. _OutputState_Tuple_Specification:

    * **OutputState specification tuples** -- these are convenience formats that can be used to compactly specify an
      OutputState along with Projections to or from it in any of the following ways:

        * **2-item tuple:** *(<State name or list of State names>, <Mechanism>)* -- 1st item must be the name of an
          `InputState` or `ModulatorySignal`, or a list of such names, and the 2nd item must be the Mechanism to
          which they all belong.  Projections of the relevant types are created for each of the specified States
          (see `State 2-item tuple <State_2_Item_Tuple>` for additional details).

        * **2-item tuple:** *(<State, Mechanism, or list of them>, <Projection specification>)* -- this is a contracted
          form of the 3-item tuple described below

        * **3-item tuple:** *(<value, State spec, or list of State specs>, variable spec, Projection specification)* --
          this allows the specification of State(s) to which the OutputState should project, together with a
          specification of its `variable <OutputState.variable>` attribute, and (optionally) parameters of the
          Projection(s) to use (e.g., their `weight <Projection_Base.weight>` and/or `exponent
          <Projection_Base.exponent>` attributes.  Each tuple must have at least the first two items (in the
          order listed), and can include the third:

            * **value, State specification, or list of State specifications** -- specifies either the `variable
              <InputState.variable>` of the InputState, or one or more States that should project to it.  The State
              specification(s) can be a (State name, Mechanism) tuple (see above), and/or include Mechanisms, in which
              case their `primary InputState <InputStatePrimary>` is used.  All of the State specifications must be
              consistent with (that is, their `value <State_Base.value>` must be compatible with the `variable
              <Projection_Base.variable>` of) the Projection specified in the fourth item if that is included.

            * **variable spec** -- specifies the attributes of the OutputState's `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism
              used for its `variable <OutputState.variable>` (see `OutputState_Customization`).

            * **Projection specification** (optional) -- `specifies a Projection <Projection_Specification>` that
              must be compatible with the State specification(s) in the 1st item; if there is more than one
              State specified, and the Projection specification is used, all of the States
              must be of the same type (i.e.,either InputStates or GatingSignals), and the `Projection
              Specification <Projection_Specification>` cannot be an instantiated Projection (since a
              Projection cannot be assigned more than one `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`).

.. _OutputState_Compatibility_and_Constraints:

OutputState `variable <OutputState.variable>` and `value <OutputState.value>`: Compatibility and Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The format of an OutputStates' `variable <OutputState.variable>` may have consequences that must be taken into
account when `specifying an OutputState by Components to which it projects
<OutputState_Projection_Destination_Specification>`.  These depend on the context in which the specification is
made, and possibly the value of other specifications.  These considerations and how they are handled are described
below, starting with constraints that are given the highest precedence:

  * **OutputState specified in a Mechanism's constructor** -- the specification of the OutputState's `variable
    <OutputState.variable>`, together with its `function <OutputState.function>` determine the OutputState's `value
    <OutputState.value>` (see `above <OutputState_Variable_and_Value>`).  Therefore, any specifications of the
    OutputState relevant to its `value <OutputState.value>` must also be compatible with these factors (for example,
    `specifying it by variable <OutputState_Specification_by_Variable>` or by a `MappingProjection` or an
    `InputState` to which it should project (see `above <OutputState_Projection_Destination_Specification>`).

    COMMENT:
    ***XXX EXAMPLE HERE
    COMMENT
  ..
  * **OutputState specified on its own** -- any direct specification of the OutputState's `variable
    <OutputState.variable>` is used to determine its format (e.g., `specifying it by variable
    <OutputState_Specification_by_Variable>`, or a *VARIABLE* entry in an `OutputState specification dictionary
    <OutputState_Specification_Dictionary>`.  In this case, the value of any `Components used to specify the
    OutputState <OutputState_Projection_Destination_Specification>` must be compatible with the specification of its
    `variable <OutputState.variable>` and the consequences this has for its `value <OutputState.value>` (see below).

    COMMENT:
    ***XXX EXAMPLE HERE
    COMMENT
  ..
  * **OutputState's** `value <OutputState.value>` **not constrained by any of the conditions above** -- then its
    `variable <OutputState.variable>` is determined by the default for an OutputState (the format of the first
    item of its `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` ). If the OutputState is
    `specified to project to any other Components <OutputState_Projection_Destination_Specification>`, then if the
    Component is a:


    * **InputState or Mechanism** (for which its `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` is used) -- if its
      `variable <State_Base.variable>` matches the format of the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`, a
      `MappingProjection` is created using an `IDENTITY_MATRIX`;  otherwise, a `FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` is used
      that maps the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>` to the InputState's `variable <State_Base.variable>`.

    * **MappingProjection** -- if its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` is specified, then the `sender dimensionality
      <Mapping_Matrix_Dimensionality>` of the matrix must be the same as that of the OutputState's `value
      <OutputState.value>`; if its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` is specified, but not its `matrix
      <MappingProjection.matrix>`, then a matrix is chosen that appropriately maps from the OutputState to the
      receiver (as described just above);  if neither its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` or its `receiver
      <MappingProjection.receiver>` are specified, then the Projection's `initialization is deferred
      <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` is specified.

    * **GatingProjection, GatingSignal or GatingMechanism** -- any of these can be used to specify an OutputState;
      their `value` does not need to be compatible with the OutputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` or
      `value <OutputState.value>`, however it does have to be compatible with the `modulatory parameter
      <Function_Modulatory_Params>` of the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.


.. _OutputState_Standard:

Standard OutputStates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most types of Mechanisms have a `standard_output_states` class attribute, that contains a list of predefined
OutputStates relevant to that type of Mechanism (for example, the `TransferMechanism` class has OutputStates for
calculating the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of its result).  The names of these are listed as
attributes of a class with the name *<ABBREVIATED_CLASS_NAME>_OUTPUT*.  For example, the TransferMechanism class
defines `TRANSFER_OUTPUT`, with attributes *OUTPUT_MEAN*, *OUTPUT_MEDIAN*, *OUTPUT_VARIANCE* and *OUTPUT_STD_DEV* that
are the names of predefined OutputStates in its `standard_output_states <TransferMechanism.standard_output_states>`
attribute. These can be used in the list of OutputStates specified for a TransferMechanism object, as in the
following example::

    >>> import psyneulink as pnl
    >>> my_mech = pnl.TransferMechanism(default_variable=[0,0],
    ...                                 function=pnl.Logistic(),
    ...                                 output_states=[pnl.TRANSFER_OUTPUT.RESULT,
    ...                                                pnl.TRANSFER_OUTPUT.MEAN,
    ...                                                pnl.TRANSFER_OUTPUT.VARIANCE])

In this example, ``my_mech`` is configured with three OutputStates;  the first will be named *RESULT* and will
represent logistic transform of the 2-element input vector;  the second will be named  *OUTPUT_MEAN* and will
represent mean of the result (i.e., of its two elements); and the third will be named *OUTPUT_VARIANCE* and contain
the variance of the result.

.. _OutputState_Customization:

*OutputState Customization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>` can be customized by specifying its `variable <OutputState.variable>`
and/or `function <OutputState.function>` in the **variable** and **function** arguments of the OutputState's
constructor, the corresponding entries (*VARIABLE* and *FUNCTION*) of an `OutputState specification
dictionary <OutputState_Specification_Dictionary>`, or in the variable spec (2nd) item of a `3-item tuple
<OutputState_Tuple_Specification>` for the OutputState.

.. _OutputState_Variable:

*OutputState* `variable <OutputState.variable>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, an OutputState uses the first (and often only) item of the owner Mechanism's `value
<Mechanism_Base.value>` as its `variable <OutputState.variable>`.  However, this can be customized by specifying
any other item of its `owner <OutputState.owner>`\\s `value <Mechanism_Base.value>`, the full `value
<Mechanism_Base.value>` itself, other attributes of the `owner <OutputState.owner>`, or any combination of these
using the following:

    *OWNER_VALUE* -- keyword specifying the entire `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` of the OutputState's `owner
    <OutputState.owner>`.

    *(OWNER_VALUE, <int>)* -- tuple specifying an item of the `owner <OutputState.owner>`\\'s `value
    <Mechanism_Base.value>` indexed by the int;  indexing begins with 0 (e.g.; 1 references the 2nd item).

    *<attribute name>* -- the name of an attribute of the OutputState's `owner <OutputState.owner>` (must be one
    in the `owner <OutputState.owner>`\\'s `params_dict <Mechanism.attributes_dict>` dictionary); returns the value
    of the named attribute for use in the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.

    *PARAMS_DICT* -- keyword specifying the `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism's entire `params_dict
    <Mechanism.attributes_dict>` dictionary, that contains entries for all of it accessible attributes.  The
    OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>` must be able to parse the dictionary.
    COMMENT
    ??WHERE CAN THE USER GET THE LIST OF ALLOWABLE ATTRIBUTES?  USER_PARAMS?? aTTRIBUTES_DICT?? USER ACCESSIBLE PARAMS??
    COMMENT

    *List[<any of the above items>]* -- this assigns the value of each item in the list to the corresponding item of
    the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.  This must be compatible (in number and type of elements) with
    the input expected by the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.

*OutputState* `function <OutputState.function>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the `function <OutputState.function>` of an OutputState is `Linear`, which simply assigns the
OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its `value <OutputState.value>`.  However, a different function
can be assigned, to transform and/or combine the item(s) of the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`
for use as its `value <OutputState.value>`. The function can be a PsyNeuLink `Function <Function>` or any Python
function or method, so long as the input it expects is compatible (in number and format of elements) with the
OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.

Examples
--------

In the following example, a `DDM` Mechanism named ``my_mech`` is configured with three OutputStates:

<Mechanism_Base.function>` returns a value with more than one item (i.e., a list of lists, or a 2d np.array), then an
OutputState can be assigned to any of those items by specifying its `index <OutputState.index>` attribute. An
OutputState can also be configured to transform the value of the item, by specifying a function for its `assign
<OutputState.assign>` attribute; the result will then be assigned as the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`.
An OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` and `assign <OutputState.assign>` attributes can be assigned when
the OutputState is assigned to a Mechanism, by including *INDEX* and *ASSIGN* entries in a `specification dictionary
<OutputState_Specification>` for the OutputState, as in the following example::

   ADD VERSION IN WHICH INDEX IS SPECIFIED USING DDM_standard_output_states
   CW 3/20/18: TODO: this example is flawed: if you try to execute() it, it gives divide by zero error.
COMMENT

The first two are `Standard OutputStates <OutputState_Standard>` that represent the decision variable of the DDM and
the probability of it crossing of the upper (vs. lower) threshold. The third is a custom OutputState, that computes
the entropy of the probability of crossing the upper threshold.  It uses the 3rd item of the DDM's `value <DDM.value>`
(items are indexed starting with 0), which contains the `probability of crossing the upper threshold
<DDM_PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD>`, and uses this as the input to the `Stability` Function assigned as the
OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`, that computes the entropy of the probability. The three OutputStates
will be assigned to the `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute of ``my_mech``, and their values
will be assigned as items in its `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute, in the order in which they
are listed in the **output_states** argument of the constructor for ``my_mech``.

Custom OutputStates can also be created on their own, and separately assigned or added to a Mechanism.  For example,
the ``DECISION ENTROPY`` OutputState could be created as follows::

    >>> decision_entropy_output_state = pnl.OutputState(name='DECISION ENTROPY',
    ...                                                 variable=(OWNER_VALUE, 2),
    ...                                                 function=pnl.Stability(metric=pnl.ENTROPY))

and then assigned either as::

    >>> my_mech = pnl.DDM(function=pnl.DriftDiffusionAnalytical(),
    ...                   output_states=[pnl.DDM_OUTPUT.DECISION_VARIABLE,
    ...                                  pnl.DDM_OUTPUT.PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD,
    ...                                  decision_entropy_output_state])

or::

    >>> another_decision_entropy_output_state = pnl.OutputState(name='DECISION ENTROPY',
    ...                                                variable=(OWNER_VALUE, 2),
    ...                                                function=pnl.Stability(metric=pnl.ENTROPY))
    >>> my_mech2 = pnl.DDM(function=pnl.DriftDiffusionAnalytical(),
    ...                    output_states=[pnl.DDM_OUTPUT.DECISION_VARIABLE,
    ...                                   pnl.DDM_OUTPUT.PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD])

    >>> my_mech2.add_states(another_decision_entropy_output_state) # doctest: +SKIP

Note that another new OutputState had to be used for the second example, as trying to
add the first one created for ``my_mech`` to ``my_mech2`` would have produced an error (since a State already
belonging to one Mechanism can't be added to another.

.. _OutputState_Structure:

Structure
---------

Every OutputState is owned by a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`. It can send one or more `MappingProjections
<MappingProjection>` to other Mechanisms.  If its owner is a `TERMINAL` Mechanism of a Process and/or System, then the
OutputState will also be treated as the output of that `Process <Process_Input_And_Output>` and/or of a System.  It has
the following attributes, some of which can be specified in ways that are specific to, and that can be used to
`customize, the OutputState <OutputState_Customization>`:

COMMENT:
.. _OutputState_Index:

* `index <OutputState.index>`: this determines the item of its owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` to
  which it is assigned.  By default, this is set to 0, which assigns it to the first item of the Mechanism's `value
  <Mechanism_Base.value>`.  The `index <Mechanism_Base.index>` must be equal to or less than one minus the number of
  OutputStates listed in the Mechanism's `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute.  The `variable
  <OutputState.variable>` of the OutputState must also match (in the number and type of its elements) the item of the
  Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` designated by the `index <OutputState.index>`.

.. _OutputState_Assign:

* `assign <OutputState.assign>`:  this specifies a function used to convert the item of the owner Mechanism's
  `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` (designated by the OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute), before
  providing it to the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.  The `assign <OutputState.assign>`
  attribute can be assigned any function that accept the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its input,
  and that generates a result that can be used the input for the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.
  The default is an identity function (`Linear` with **slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0), that simply assigns the
  specified item of the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` unmodified as the input for OutputState's
  `function <OutputState.function>`.
COMMENT
..
* `variable <OutputState.variable>` -- references attributes of the OutputState's `owner <OutputState.owner>` that
  are used as the input to the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`, to determine its `value
  <OutputState.value>`.  The specification must match (in both the number and types of elements it generates)
  the input to the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.  By default, the first item of the `owner
  <OutputState.owner>` Mechanisms' `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` is used.  However, this can be customized as
  described under `OutputState_Customization`.

* `function <OutputState.function>` -- takes the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its input, and
  generates the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>` as its result.  The default function is `Linear` that simply
  assigns the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its `value <OutputState.value>`.  However, the
  parameters of the `function <OutputState.function>` -- and thus the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState --
  can be modified by `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState (listed in its
  `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.  A custom function can also be specified, so long as it can
  take as its input a value that is compatible with the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.

* `projections <OutputState.projections>` -- all of the `Projections <Projection>` sent and received by the OutputState;

.. _OutputState_Efferent_Projections:

* `efferents <OutputState.path_afferents>` -- `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` that project from the
  OutputState.

.. _OutputState_Modulatory_Projections:

* `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>` -- `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` that project to the OutputState,
  the `value <GatingProjection.value>` of which can modify the OutputState's `value <InputState.value>` (see the
  descriptions of Modulation under `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` and `GatingSignals
  <GatingSignal_Modulation>` for additional details).  If the OutputState receives more than one GatingProjection,
  their values are combined before they are used to modify the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState.
..
* `value <OutputState.value>`:  assigned the result of the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`, possibly
  modified by any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState. It is used as the input to any
  projections that the OutputStatue sends.


.. _OutputState_Execution:

Execution
---------

An OutputState cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the Mechanism to which it belongs is executed.
When the Mechanism is executed, the values of its attributes specified for the OutputState's `variable
<OutputState.variable>` (see `OutputState_Customization`) are used as the input to the OutputState's `function
<OutputState.function>`. The OutputState is updated by calling its `function <OutputState.function>`.  The result,
modified by any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` the OutputState receives (listed in its `mod_afferents
<OutputState.mod_afferents>` attribute), is assigned as the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState.  This is
assigned to a corresponding item of the Mechanism's `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute,
and is used as the input to any projections for which the OutputState is the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`.

    COMMENT:

        Description
        -----------
            The OutputState class is a type in the State category of Component,
            It is used primarily as the sender for MappingProjections
            Its FUNCTION updates its value:
                note:  currently, this is the identity function, that simply maps variable to value

        Class attributes:
            + componentType (str) = OUTPUT_STATES
            + paramClassDefaults (dict)
                + FUNCTION (Linear)
                + FUNCTION_PARAMS   (Operation.PRODUCT)

        Class methods:
            function (executes function specified in params[FUNCTION];  default: Linear)

        StateRegistry
        -------------
            All OutputStates are registered in StateRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    COMMENT


    Arguments
    ---------

    owner : Mechanism
        the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` to which the OutputState belongs; it must be specified or determinable from the
        context in which the OutputState is created.

    reference_value : number, list or np.ndarray
        a template that specifies the format of the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`;  if it is
        specified in addition to the **variable** argument, then these must be compatible (both in the number and
        type of elements).  It is used to insure the compatibility of the source of the input for the OutputState
        with its `function <OutputState.function>`.

    variable : number, list or np.ndarray
        specifies the attributes of the  OutputState's `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism to be used by the
        OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`  in generating its `value <OutputState.value>`.

    COMMENT:
    size : int, list or ndarray of ints
        specifies variable as array(s) of zeros if **variable** is not passed as an argument;
        if **variable** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of **size**.
        As an example, the following mechanisms are equivalent::
            T1 = TransferMechanism(size = [3, 2])
            T2 = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0]])
    COMMENT

    function : Function, function, or method : default Linear
        specifies the function used to transform and/or combine the items designated by the OutputState's `variable
        <OutputState.variable>` into its `value <OutputState.value>`, under the possible influence of
        `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState.

    COMMENT:
    index : int : default PRIMARY
        specifies the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` used as input for the
        function specified by the OutputState's `assign <OutputState.assign>` attribute, to determine the
        OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`.

    assign : Function, function, or method : default Linear

    COMMENT

    projections : list of Projection specifications
        species the `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` to be sent by the OutputState, and/or
        `GatingProjections(s) <GatingProjection>` to be received (see `OutputState_Projections` for additional details);
        these will be listed in its `efferents <OutputState.efferents>` and `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>`
        attributes, respectively (see `OutputState_Projections` for additional details).

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the OutputState, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values specified for parameters
        in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default see `name <OutputState.name>`
        specifies the name of the OutputState; see OutputState `name <OutputState.name>` for details.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default State.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the OutputState; see `prefs <OutputState.prefs>` for details.


    Attributes
    ----------

    owner : Mechanism
        the Mechanism to which the OutputState belongs.

    mod_afferents : List[GatingProjection]
        `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState.

    variable : value, list or np.ndarray
        the value(s) of the item(s) of the `owner <OutputState.owner>` Mechanism's attributes specified in the
        **variable** argument of the constructor, or a *VARIABLE* entry in the `OutputState specification dictionary
        <OutputState_Specification_Dictionary>` used to construct the OutputState.

    COMMENT:
    index : int
        the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` used as input for the function specified by
        its `assign <OutputState.assign>` attribute (see `index <OutputState_Index>` for additional details).

    assign : function or method
        function used to convert the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` specified by
        the OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute.  The result is combined with the result of the
        OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>` to determine both the `value <OutputState.value>` of the
        OutputState, as well as the value of the corresponding item of the owner Mechanism's `output_values
        <Mechanism_Base.output_values>`. The default (`Linear`) transfers the value unmodified  (see `assign
        <OutputState_Assign>` for additional details)
    COMMENT

    function : Function, function, or method
        function used to transform and/or combine the value of the items of the OutputState's `variable
        <OutputState.variable>` into its `value <OutputState.value>`, under the possible influence of
        `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState.

    value : number, list or np.ndarray
        assigned the result of `function <OutputState.function>`;  the same value is assigned to the corresponding item
        of the owner Mechanism's `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute.

    label : string or number
        the string label that represents the current `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState, according to the
        owner mechanism's `output_labels_dict <Mechanism.output_labels_dict>`. If the current
        `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState does not have a corresponding label, then the numeric
        `value <OutputState.value>` is returned.

    efferents : List[MappingProjection]
        `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` sent by the OutputState (i.e., for which the OutputState
        is a `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`).

    projections : List[Projection]
        all of the `Projections <Projection>` received and sent by the OutputState.

    name : str
        the name of the OutputState; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a default is
        assigned by the OutputStateRegistry of the Mechanism to which the OutputState belongs.  Note that most
        Mechanisms automatically create one or more `Standard OutputStates <OutputState_Standard>`, that have
        pre-specified names.  However, if any OutputStates are specified in the **input_states** argument of the
        Mechanism's constructor, those replace its Standard OutputStates (see `note
        <Mechanism_Default_State_Suppression_Note>`);  `standard naming conventions <Naming>` apply to the
        OutputStates specified, as well as any that are added to the Mechanism once it is created.

        .. note::
            Unlike other PsyNeuLink components, State names are "scoped" within a Mechanism, meaning that States with
            the same name are permitted in different Mechanisms.  However, they are *not* permitted in the same
            Mechanism: States within a Mechanism with the same base name are appended an index in the order of their
            creation.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OutputState; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).

            * None -- assigns `None` to VARIABLE entries for all OutputStates for which it is not already specified.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : dict
        dictionary of OutputState specification dictionaries

    indices : list
        list of default indices for each OutputState specified

    names : list
        list of the default names for each OutputState
