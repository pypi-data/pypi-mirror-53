        **Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational
        Science**
        
        AiiDA is a sophisticated framework designed from scratch to be a
        flexible and scalable infrastructure for computational science. Being
        able to store the full data provenance of each simulation, and based on
        a tailored database solution built for efficient data mining
        implementations, AiiDA gives the user the ability to interact seamlessly
        with any number of HPC machines and codes thanks to its flexible plugin
        interface, together with a powerful workflow engine for the automation
        of simulations.
