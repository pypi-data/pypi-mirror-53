# json-subschema checker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/jsonsubschema.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/jsonsubschema)

This tool checks if one JSON schema is subtype of another.
For two JSON schemas s1 and s2, s1 <: s2 (reads s1 is subtype/subset or subschema of s2) 
is every instance that validates against s1 also validates against s2.


This project is still in its early stage.
