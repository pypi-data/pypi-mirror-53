Description: 
        gridfinder uses NASA night time lights imagery to as an indicator of 
        settlements/towns with grid electricity access. Then a minimum spanning 
        tree is calculated for these connect points, using the Dijkstra 
        algorithm and using existing road networks as a cost function.
