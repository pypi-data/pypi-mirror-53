Description: # DtwSom
        
        ## Dynamic Time Warping Self Organizing Map
        
        DtwSom is a python implementation of Dynamic Time Warping Self Organizing Map (DTW-SOM).DTW-SOM substitutes the original SOM distance measurement to dynamic time warping distance, moreover it uses the dynamic time warping alignment in training other than the original element-wise alignment. These changes will allow DTW-SOM to outperform SOM in time series clustering. A multi-variate DTW-SOM has also been developed.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just use pip:
        
            pip install dtwsom
        
        or download DtwSom to a directory of your choice and use the setup script:
        
            git clone https://github.com/Kenan-Li/dtwsom.git
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Compatibility notes
        
        DtwSom has been tested under Python 3.6.4.
