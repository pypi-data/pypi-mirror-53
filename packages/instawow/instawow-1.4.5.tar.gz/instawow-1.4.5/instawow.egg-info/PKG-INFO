Description: *instawow*
        ==========
        
        *instawow* is a package manager for World of Warcraft, written
        in Python.  It can be used to install, remove and update add-ons from
        WoWInterface, CurseForge and Tukui.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It is recommended to install *instawow* in an isolated environment.
        One option is to use `pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`__::
        
            pipx install instawow
        
        Installing with `pip` is also supported::
        
            pip3 install --upgrade instawow
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        *instawow* is able to interpret add-on URLs, slugs and IDs.
        All of the following will install Molinari::
        
            instawow install https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/molinari
            instawow install curse:molinari
            instawow install curse:20338
            instawow install https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13188-Molinari.html
            instawow install wowi:13188
        
        * The ``update`` and ``remove`` commands work in the same way, and ``update``
          can be run without arguments to update all add-ons.
        * You can opt into alpha and beta quality add-ons by
          using the ``strategy`` option on ``install``.  This option is only
          supported by CurseForge.
        * Use ``list`` to list add-ons managed by *instawow*; ``list-folders -e`` to
          list unmanaged add-ons; ``info`` to display add-on information,
          ``visit`` to open an add-on homepage in your browser and ``reveal`` to
          open the primary add-on folder in your file manager.
        * Non-destructive operations accept partial URIs, e.g.
          ``instawow info moli`` will display information about Molinari.
        
        instafying add-ons
        ----------------------
        
        *instawow* does not know about add-ons it did not itself install.
        The Twitch and Minion clients each use their own, proprietary
        fingerprinting algorithm to reconcile add-ons you have installed with add-ons
        their respective hosts keep on their servers.  Though the details of their implementation
        elude me, *instawow* tries to accomplish something similar by combining a variety
        of cues (e.g. folders and TOC entries).  This is not done automatically;
        you will need to execute ``instawow reconcile`` to absorb add-ons installed
        by other means.
        
        WoW Classic
        -----------
        
        *instawow* supports Classic – it will correctly install Classic versions
        of add-ons from sources depending on the value of the
        ``game_flavour`` configuration setting.
        What *instawow* does not have is a switch you can flick to go from managing
        your retail add-ons to managing your classic add-ons and vice versa.
        This was a conscious design decision, the merits of which (I should admit)
        are open to debate.  If you are already using *instawow* for retail,
        you will need to create a separate profile for Classic.  On Linux, this might be::
        
            env INSTAWOW_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/instawow-classic instawow
        
        For ease of use, you might want to set up an alias.  In your Bash profile, add::
        
            alias instawow-classic='INSTAWOW_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/instawow-classic instawow'
        
        You would then be able to invoke *instawow* using ``instawow-classic``.
        
        Additional functionality
        ------------------------
        
        WeakAuras aura updater
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        *instawow* contains a WeakAuras updater modelled after
        `WeakAuras Companion <https://weakauras.wtf/>`__.  To use the updater
        and provided that you have WeakAuras installed::
        
            instawow weakauras-companion build -a <your account name>
            instawow install instawow:weakauras-companion
        
        You will have to rebuild the companion add-on prior to updating
        to receive aura updates.  If you would like to check for updates on
        every invocation of ``instawow update``, install the
        ``instawow:weakauras-companion-autoupdate`` variant, exposing your account
        name as an env var::
        
            env WAC_ACCOUNT=<your account name> instawow install instawow:weakauras-companion-autoupdate
            env WAC_ACCOUNT=<your account name> instawow update
        
        You may then choose to bypass the companion add-on simply by ommitting the env var.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        Searching for add-ons
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        *instawow* tries to make installing, updating and removing
        add-ons quick and painless for those of us who are
        (ever so slightly) proficient with the command line
        and do not revel in using bloatware which infringe on our privacy
        or inhabiting walled gardens.
        It does not try to circumvent add-on portals entirely.
        
        Metadata sourcing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Originally, *instawow* relied on the official feeds provided by Curse.
        Curse retired the feeds in June 2018 and – for a period – *instawow* would
        scrape the CurseForge website.  The alternative would have been to use the
        old XML-like API.  Because the API was not built for third-party use, it had not been
        isolated from user accounts (cf. GitHub integrations).
        If users were to log into the API, *instawow* would acquire full
        access to their account.  Authentication was also complicated
        by the ongoing Curse account migration to Twitch and is (or should be)
        unnecessary for the simple use case of installing and updating add-ons.
        Thankfully, Twitch migrated to an unauthenticated
        API interally in Q2 2019, which we have adopted for our own use.
        This is similar to what Minion, the WoWInterface-branded add-on manager, has been
        doing for years.  The good people at Tukui provide an API for public use.
        *instawow* might break whenever one of our sources introduces
        a change to their website or API (though only temporarily).
