GSEA-InContext: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis In Context
========

NOTE: A copy of the GSEA-InContext Python package, but with all graphics- and plot-related functionality removed so that it can be used on shinyapps.io, which cannot use packages that require access to the display (e.g., packages that require Tcl/Tk). The full package with plotting capability is `here <https://pypi.org/project/gsea-incontext>`_
