==============
Blanket Orders
==============

A blanket order is a pre-agreement to sell a certain number of quantities of
products at a specific price. From a confirmed blanket order, the users can
create new sale orders at such price, until the blanket order expires, either
due to reaching the validity date or exhausting all the quantities of products.

Usage
=====

A new menu in the Sale area is created, allowing users to create new blanket
orders.
