        ViXeN is a simple tool to facilitate easily viewing, adding, and annotating
        metadata associated with media.  ViXeN has been designed primarily to assist
        field biologists with managing the large amount of media they collect in
        a minimally intrusive manner.
        
        One may think of ViXeN as a special, customizable file browser with which
        one may view and edit metadata associated with media files like videos, images,
        and audio.
        
        The ViXeN documentation is at https://vixen.readthedocs.io
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Works with different types of media, videos, images, audio, text, and PDF.
        - Supports any number of user-defined metadata fields per project.
        - Does not modify the original media but keeps its metadata separately.
        - Powerful searching through metadata.
        - Lightweight and easy to install.  No server setup required.
        - Cross-platform: works on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
        - Simple browser-based UI.
        - Support to export metadata to a CSV file and import tags from a CSV file.
        - Ability to add metadata for media through an external program or a Python
          script.
        - Support to allow user-defined conversions of media to supported versions.
        - Open source.
        
        ViXeN has currently been tested with about 350k files in a single project. It
        will work fine for larger projects but will be progressively slower the larger
        the number of files. The speed does not however depend on the nature of the
        media. ViXeN does not currently support multiple people working on the same
        project at the same time.
        
        
        Download
        ---------
        
        If you are not familiar with Python you can install ViXeN using a very simple
        binary installer on all the major platforms. To try out ViXeN please download
        a binary installer from here:
        
          https://github.com/vixen-project/vixen/releases
        
        These are very easy to install, basically just download, unzip, and run.
        
        If you are familiar with Python packages, you can install ViXeN using the
        standard Python mechanisms of either running `python setup.py install` or with
        [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) using `pip install vixen`. Once installed, simply
        run `vixen` to start the application.
        
        
        History
        --------
        
        ViXeN was envisaged as a 'no-fuss' means to manage videos from 32 camera traps
        that were set up in the Banni grasslands in north-west India to survey species
        occurrence and interaction patterns, with a focus on carnivores. The research
        project began in 2013 and as of 2015 has resulted in 6000+ videos. When
        confronted with the daunting task of viewing and managing such volumes of
        media files, we realized that there was a dearth for tools to aid in the
        processing of such data. There were data managers for images but nothing suitable
        for video (and to a certain extent, audio) files.
        
        Support

        If you have any questions or are having any problems with ViXeN, please email
        or post your questions on the vixen-users mailing list here:
        https://groups.google.com/d/forum/vixen
        
        If you should have specific problems with ViXeN, you may eitiher email us on
        the list mentioned above or file an issue on github here:
        https://github.com/vixen-project/vixen/issues/new
        
        If you do not mind, you can consider sending along the [vixen log
        file](https://vixen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#troubleshooting).
        
        We welcome any contributions to this project. Please submit a pull-request on
        github and we will be happy to consider any suggestions and improvements.
        
        One useful, and perhaps underutilized feature of github is that if you want to
        make a change to the software or documentation, you may do so directly on
        github and submit that as a pull-request for us to consider without having to
        learn git, forking the project, and manually submitting a pull-request.
