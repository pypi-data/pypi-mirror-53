Description: A python implementation of the canonical serialization for the Libra network.
        
        Canonical serialization guarantees byte consistency when serializing an in-memory
        data structure. It is useful for situations where two parties want to efficiently compare
        data structures they independently maintain. It happens in consensus where
        independent validators need to agree on the state they independently compute. A cryptographic
        hash of the serialized data structure is what ultimately gets compared. In order for
        this to work, the serialization of the same data structures must be identical when computed
        by independent validators potentially running different implementations
        of the same spec in different languages.
