# Zathura
Zathura is a sqlite3 based logger. Currently, you can see your error and debug logs from terminal only. However, I am working on webview. Do keep in mind, you will have to handle the authentication for your own project.

-------------------------------
## How to install
<ul> <pre> pip install zathura </pre> </ul>
This will install the latest version on your virtualenv

-------------------------------
## Code Preview
<p>
1.  You can just import Zathura from ZathuraProject.zathura and call insert_error_log function to start logging your errors right away.
<pre>
from ZathuraProject.zathura import Zathura

zathura = Zathura()
zathura.insert_error_log(user_id, error_name, long_error_description)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
2. View your logs from terminal
<pre>
zathura help
</pre>
This will list all the avaiable command for you. Choose from them to see how you want to sort your logs.
<pre>
usage: Zathura COMMAND [args] ...
For example: { Zathura v } will show the current version of this pacakge.
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
All commands: 
[[ v ]] : Show the current version of this package
[[ developer ]] : Search based on developers name. You can filter out the result based on date and descending order
[[ debug_origin ]] : Shows debug messages based on point of origin. Point of origin is the class/function from where you are adding a message in sqlite.
[[ error_user ]] : Shows error generated under the given username
[[ all_debug ]] : Shows all debug messages
[[ error_name ]] : Shows error based on a error name.
[[ date ]] : Shows error occurred in between a specific date.
[[ all_error ]] : Shows all error messages
[[ origin ]] : Shows error generated on the given point of origin
[[ mark_resolve ]] : Given an error name and point of origin all errors logged on database, is marked resolved.
[[ delete_debug ]] : Deletes the last seven days of debug mesasges from the database. It is useful if you dont want to clutter the database with unnecessary debug info.
[[ help ]] : Shows all the commands necessary to run this package from terminal
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
For example to see all error, without sorting you can just type
<pre> zathura all_error </pre>
</p>
