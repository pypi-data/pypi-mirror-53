        Python Library for writing progress texts, echo messages, warnings and errors to standard output
        
        
        **Examples:**
        
        ### 1 - Default prefix ###
        
        ```python
        from screenwriter import Screenwriter
        
        sw = Screenwriter ()
        sw.echo ('my output')
        ```
        ```
        Output:
        2019-07-26-11:16:04 my output
        ```
        
        ### 2 - Date Time parts in prefix ###
        
        ```python
        from screenwriter import Screenwriter
        
        sw = Screenwriter ('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f ')
        sw.echo ('my output')
        ```
        ```
        Output:
        2019-07-26 11:16:04 my output
        ```
         
        ### 3 - Error, Warning & Info standard prefixes ###
        
        ```python
        from screenwriter import Screenwriter
        
        sw = Screenwriter ()
        sw.error ('an error message')
        sw.warn  ('a warming message')
        sw.info  ('an informational message')
        ```
        ```
        Output:
        2019-07-29-11:39:00 ERROR: an error message
        2019-07-29-11:39:00 WARN:  a warming message
        2019-07-29-11:39:00 INFO:  an informational message
        ```
        
        ### 4 - Trimming content length  ###
        By default, log strings are trimmed to 120 chars.
        You can change this setting:
        ```python
        from screenwriter import Screenwriter
        	
        sw = Screenwriter ()
        sw.set_maxlen (80) #Set maximum length to 80
        ```
        
        ### 5 - Dynamically toggele output ###
        
        You can toggle the output between ON and OFF. 
        
        ```python
        from screenwriter import Screenwriter
        
        sw = Screenwriter ()
        sw.echo ('print this line')
        sw.set_verbose (False)
        sw.echo ('do not print this line')
        sw.set_verbose (True)
        sw.echo ('print this line')
        ```
        ```
        Output:
        2019-10-05-20:09:10 print this line
        2019-10-05-20:09:10 print this line
        ```
