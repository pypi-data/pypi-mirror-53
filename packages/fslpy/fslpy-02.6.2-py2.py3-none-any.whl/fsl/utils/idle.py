# idle.py - Run functions on an idle loop or in a separate thread.
#
# Author: Paul McCarthy <pauldmccarthy@gmail.com>
#
"""This module provides functions and classes for running tasks
asynchronously, either in an idle loop, or on a separate thread.


.. note:: The *idle* functions in this module are intended to be run from
          within a ``wx`` application. However, they will still work without
          ``wx``, albeit with slightly modified behaviour.


Idle tasks
----------

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   block
   idle
   idleWhen
   inIdle
   cancelIdle
   idleReset
   getIdleTimeout
   setIdleTimeout


The :func:`idle` function is a simple way to run a task on an ``wx``
``EVT_IDLE`` event handler. This effectively performs the same job as the
:func:`run` function, but is more suitable for short tasks which do not
warrant running in a separate thread.


The ``EVT_IDLE`` event is generated automatically by ``wx``. However, there
are some circumstances in which ``EVT_IDLE`` will not be generated, and
pending events may be left on the queue. For this reason, the
:func:`_wxIdleLoop` will occasionally use a ``wx.Timer`` to ensure that it
continues to be called. The time-out used by this ``Timer`` can be queried
and set via the :func:`getIdleTimeout` and :func:`setIdleTimeout` functions.


Thread tasks
------------

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   run
   wait
   TaskThread


The :func:`run` function simply runs a task in a separate thread.  This
doesn't seem like a worthy task to have a function of its own, but the
:func:`run` function additionally provides the ability to schedule another
function to run on the ``wx.MainLoop`` when the original function has
completed.  This therefore gives us a simple way to run a computationally
intensitve task off the main GUI thread (preventing the GUI from locking up),
and to perform some clean up/refresh afterwards.


The :func:`wait` function is given one or more ``Thread`` instances, and a
task to run. It waits until all the threads have finished, and then runs
the task (via :func:`idle`).


The :class:`TaskThread` class is a simple thread which runs a queue of tasks.


Other facilities
----------------


The ``idle`` module also defines the :func:`mutex` decorator, which is
intended to be used to mark the methods of a class as being mutually exclusive.
The ``mutex`` decorator uses the :class:`MutexFactory` class to do its work.

                       to ``False``. This argument takes precedence over the
                       ``skipIfQueued`` argument.

    :arg skipIfQueued: Optional. If provided, must be provided as a keyword
                       argument. If ``True``, and a task with the given
                       ``name`` is already enqueud, (or is running), the
                       function is not called. Defaults to ``False``.

    :arg alwaysQueue:  Optional. If provided, must be provided as a keyword
                       argument. If ``True``, and a ``wx.MainLoop`` is not
                       running, the task is enqueued anyway, under the
                       assumption that a ``wx.MainLoop`` will be started in
                       the future. Note that, if ``wx.App`` has not yet been
                       created, another  call to ``idle`` must be made after
                       the app has been created for the original task to be
                       executed. If ``wx`` is not available, this parameter
                       will be ignored, and the task executed directly.


    All other arguments are passed through to the task function.


    If a ``wx.App`` is not running, the ``timeout``, ``name`` and
    ``skipIfQueued`` arguments are ignored. Instead, the call will sleep for
    ``after`` seconds, and then the ``task`` is called directly.


    .. note:: If the ``after`` argument is used, there is no guarantee that
              the task will be executed in the order that it is scheduled.
              This is because, if the required time has not elapsed when
              the task is popped from the queue, it will be re-queued.

    .. note:: If you schedule multiple tasks with the same ``name``, and you
              do not use the ``skipIfQueued`` or ``dropIfQueued`` arguments,
              all of those tasks will be executed, but you will only be able
              to query/cancel the most recently enqueued task.

    .. note:: You will run into difficulties if you schedule a function that
              expects/accepts its own keyword arguments called ``name``,
              ``skipIfQueued``, ``dropIfQueued``, ``after``, ``timeout``, or
