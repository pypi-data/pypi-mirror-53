Description: 
        ## What is it?
        Planetoids is a high level Python API for generating interactive, procedurally generated worlds from data in a pandas DataFrame.
        
        ## What does it do?
        Currently, Planetoids is able to terraform a planet from two-dimensional data that has an optional cluster attribute. It's still very new and will be growing in capabilities, but for now the library can achieve the following when terraforming a new world:
        
        + generates somewhere in _space_ to render your creation
        + generates an ecology based on input data statistics
        + generates land masses
        	+ these land masses have 
        		+ topographic detail (contours) 
        		+ relief detail (gradients)
        + generates lighting effects in the form of a hillshade
