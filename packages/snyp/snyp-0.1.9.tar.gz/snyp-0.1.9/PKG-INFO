Description: # Snyp
        Snyp is a command line utility that streamlines the process of creating text based documentation and programming tutorials in Markdown.
        
        Snyp extracts specified code snippets from a source file, formats them to enable syntax highlighting in Github Flavored Markdown and prefixes them with a comment exactly specifying where the snippet was extracted from, i.e.:
        
        
            ```python
            # snippet from example.py lines 1-2
            print('Hey there!')
            print('This is an example')
            ```
        Which would be rendered like this:
        ```python
        # snippet from example.py lines 1-2
        print('Hey there!')
        print('This is an example')
        ```
        ## Installation:
        ```pip install snyp```
        
        ## Usage:  ```snyp --help```
        
        ```bash
        Usage: snyp.py [OPTIONS] [LINES]...
        
          Use this tool to extract code snippets from a source file (src) and append
          them to a markdown file (dest)  with proper Github Flavored Markdown
          formatting.
        
          You can use 0, 1 or 2 'lines' arguments:
        
          With 0 arguments, the entire source file will be extracted
        
          With 1 argument, the entire source file starting at lines[0] will be
          extracted
        
          With 2 arguments, lines lines[0] to lines[1] (inclusively) will be
          extracted from the source file
        
          Use snip --config to view and update the configuration
        
        Options:
          -s, --src TEXT   The source file from which to extract the code snippet
          -d, --dest TEXT  The destination file to which to append the formatted
                           snippet. "-" for stdout
          -l, --lang TEXT  The language specific formatting to be applied to the code
                           snippet
          -c, --config     Edit the configuration, i.e. to change defaults, add
                           languages, etc.
          --help           Show this message and exit.
        ```
        ## Configuration ```snyp --config```
        The above command will open Snyp's configuration file in your default editor. It's the easiest way to view and update the configuration.
        ### Section [default]
        
        ```ini
        # snippet from snyp.ini lines 1-5 
        [default]
        default = python
        src = snyp.py
        dest = README.md
        
        
        ```
        + default: the default language profile to use if -l, --lang is not provided
        + src: relative path to the default source file if -s, --src is not provided
        + dest: relative path to the default destination file if -d, --dest is not provided
        
        ### Language sections: [python], etc.
        
        ```ini
        # snippet from snyp.ini lines 16-19 
        [html]
        lang = html
        commentStart = <!--
        commentEnd = -->
        
        ```
        + lang: name of the language. Is used for the prefix that determines syntax highlighting
        + commentStart: How a comment starts in *lang*
        + commentEnd (optional): How a comment ends in *lang*
