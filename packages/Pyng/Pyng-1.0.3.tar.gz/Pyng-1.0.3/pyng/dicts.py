    Given a data structure of arbitrary depth -- scalar, iterable, associative
    -- any element of which might be another container -- search for elements
    for which 'pred' (a callable accepting an entry) returns True.

    This function is a generator which will eventually traverse the whole
    structure in depth-first order. It DOES NOT DEFEND against circularity.

    Every time pred(element) returns True, yield a tuple that can be used to
    navigate the data structure back to the found element. The tuple is
    constructed as follows:

    Each element of the tuple steps down to the next level of the data
    structure.

    If the current level of the data structure is a dict, the corresponding
    tuple element is the dict key.

    If the current level of the data structure is a list or tuple, the
    corresponding tuple element is the int index.

    If the entire data structure is a scalar for which pred(d) returns True,
    the tuple will be empty.

    Thus, a loop like this:

    element = d
    for t in yielded_tuple:
        element = element[t]

    should make pred(element) return True.
