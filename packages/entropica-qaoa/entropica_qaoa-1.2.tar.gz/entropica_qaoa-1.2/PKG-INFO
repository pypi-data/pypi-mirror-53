Description: # Entropica QAOA
        
        A modular package providing multiple features and workflow tools for the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA), facilitating its use, prototyping, and testing. Includes several different parametrisations, integration with data science and graph analysis libraries such as Pandas and NetworkX, numerous utility functions, and convenient optimiser logging and analysis tools. Documentation contains extensive and didactic examples. 
        
        Read more about EntropicaQAOA on our [blog](https://medium.com/@entropicalabs/entropica-releases-qaoa-package-for-rigettis-quantum-cloud-service-12ea71019436).
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The documentation for EntropicaQAOA can be found [here](https://docs.entropicalabs.io/qaoa/). Alternatively, it can be complied locally as follows:
        
        **Install the Prerequisites**
        ```bash
        pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-autodoc-typehints nbsphinx nbconvert
        ```
        
        **Compile the documentation**
        ```bash
        cd docs && make html
        ```
        
        The compiled HTML version of the documentation is then found in
        `entropica_qaoa/docs/build/html`.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        We assume that the user has already installed Rigetti's pyQuil package, as well as the Rigetti QVM and Quil Compiler. For instructions on how to do so, see Rigetti's documentation [here](http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/start.html).
        
        You can install the `EntropicaQAOA` package using [pip](#https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):
        
        ```bash
        pip install entropica-qaoa
        ```
        To upgrade to the latest version: 
        
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade entropica-qaoa
        ```
        
        If you want to run the Demo Notebooks, you will additionally need to install `scikit-learn` and `scikit-optimize`, which can be done as follows:
        
        ```bash
        pip install scikit-learn && pip install scikit-optimize
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can clone directly from GitHub:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/entropicalabs/entropica_qaoa.git
        ```
        
        ### Testing
        
        All software tests are located in `entropica_qaoa/tests/`. To run them you will need to install [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). To speed up the testing, we have tagged tests that require more computational time (~ 5 mins or so)  with `runslow`, and the tests of the notebooks with `notebooks`. The commands are as follows:
        
         - `pytest` runs the default tests, and skips both the longer tests that need heavier simulations, as well as tests of the Notebooks in the `examples` directory.
         - `pytest --runslow` runs the the tests that require longer time.
         - `pytest --notebooks` runs the Notebook tests. To achieve this, the notebooks are
            converted to python scripts, and then executed. Should any errors occur, this means that the line numbers given in the error
            messages refer to the lines in `<TheNotebook>.py`, and not in
            `<TheNotebook>.ipynb`.
         - `pytest --all` runs all of the above tests. 
        
        ### QPU access
        
        EntropicaQAOA provides full native support for Rigetti’s QVM and QPUs. For access to the QPUs, sign up online at https://qcs.rigetti.com/, or reach out to support@rigetti.com.
