Genomic analyses require flexible models that can be adapted to the needs of the user.

Limix is a flexible and efficient linear mixed model library with interfaces to Python.
It includes methods for

- Single-variant association and interaction testing
- Variance decompostion analysis with linear mixed models
- Association and interaction set tests
- Different utils for statistical analysis, basic i/o, and plotting.

We have an extensive [documentation](https://limix.readthedocs.io) of the library.
If you need further help or want to discuss anything related to limix, please, join our [forum](https://forum.limix.io/) ðŸ’¬ and have a chat with us ðŸ˜ƒ.
