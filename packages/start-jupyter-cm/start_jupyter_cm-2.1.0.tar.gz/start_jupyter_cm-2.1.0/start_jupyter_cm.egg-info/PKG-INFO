        Description
        -----------
        
        Add entries to start the Jupyter Notebook and QtConsole from the file
        manager context menu. This offers a convenient way of starting Jupyter
        in a folder. Currently it only supports Microsoft Windows, GNOME (and
        its many derivatives), and macOS. Contributions to support other OSs/desktop
        environments are highly welcome.
        
        `WinPython <http://winpython.github.io>`__ and `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`__/`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ distributions are supported. If run from a conda environment other than `root`, the name of the environment will be specified in brackets in the context menu name. 
        
        Microsoft Windows

        In addition to starting the QtConsole, the Jupyter Notebook or the Jupyter Lab, 
        and launching the default browser, in Microsoft Windows the process runs from 
        a terminal. Closing the terminal closes the QtConsole or the Jupyter server.
        Single and all users installations are supported, see installation instructions below.
        
        GNOME
        ~~~~~

        When selecting multiple folders, one instance of Jupyter
        QtConsole/notebook/lab opens in each of the selected folders. Selecting a
        file starts Jupyter in the file directory.
        
        Note that in GNOME the processes run in the background. As of Jupyter
        Notebook 4.1 there is no way to shutdown the server from the notebook
        UI. To stop the server one has to manually kill the process.
        Alternatively, `nbmanager <https://github.com/takluyver/nbmanager>`__
        can discover all running servers and shut them down using via an UI.
        
        GNOME >= 2.22 is required.
        
        macOS
        ~~~~~
        
        .. figure:: images/jupyter_cm_macos.png

        The context menu is only available when an object (folder or file) is 
        selected in Finder. The Jupyter options will be available from the
        "Services" section of the menu. If a folder is selected then an instance of 
        Jupyter QTConsole/notebook/lab opens in the selected folder. If a file
        is selected then Jupyter is started in the file directory. If the 
        file is a jupyter notebook (\*.ipynb), then selecting Jupyter notebook/lab
        will open the file in that program; Jupyter QtConsole will still only
        open in the file directory.
        
        As the processes are opened through a shell script in Automator, a spinning
        cog will be visible in the menu bar when the processes are running. Once you
        have finished with the server then manually kill the process via the 
        drop-down menu from this spinning cog.
        
        The launchers have been tested on macOS Mojave (10.14.6).
        
        Installation instructions
        -------------------------
        
        
        Any platform
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install from pypi using pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install start_jupyter_cm
        
        Or install from conda-forge channel using conda (in a Anaconda/Miniconda distribution):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ conda install -c conda-forge start_jupyter_cm
        
        After installation, enable the context menu entries from a terminal as follows:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ start_jupyter_cm
        
        To remove the context menu entries execute the following in a terminal:
        
        .. code::
        
            $ start_jupyter_cm --remove
        
        To uninstall the package:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip uninstall start_jupyter_cm
        
        On Microscoft Windows, the administrator rights are required to add the 
        entry for all users, otherwise the entries will be added only for the 
        current user. In GNOME and OSX only for the current user.
        
        Also, be aware that, uninstalling the package does not
        remove the context menu entries. If you are left with the context menu
        entries after uninstalling ``start_jupyter_cm``, reinstall it, remove
        the entries as above and uninstall it again.
        
        Microsoft Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In Microsoft Windows the preferred way to install this package would be
        using the Windows MSI installers if it wasn't for `this Python
        bug <http://bugs.python.org/issue13276>`__. Until this issue is fixed, we will
        not distribute MSI installers.
